This guide provides an introduction to new members on ASAM’s most central topics and gives an overview on how to get involved. It provides an overview over all relevant basics to get you up and running for your ASAM project. ASAM tries to keep technical requirements for participation as low as possible. That is why you can participate without having to install any software on your computer. All the tools most project members will need to contribute to their project are hosted online and can be accessed through any standard web browser. The only thing you need to do first is to set up your account so you can safely exchange data with the other project members. Here is a quick overview of what you need to do to get started: Set up your account for your project’s remote repository (GitLab or GitHub, depending on your project) Check out your project’s README file — you can find it right at the top of your project’s remote repository Make yourself familiar with ASAM’s contribution workflow, the available issue labels, and the meeting guidelines Check the development phase overview page Read the section on documentation-as-code to understand the concepts behind the ASAM documentation process If you have any questions or feedback, do not hesitate to contact your ASAM representative. This guide assumes you already know who and what ASAM is.

This concept refers to using the same tools and methods for documentation (or standardization) as for writing (software) code. The main benefit of this concept is the separation of content and text in documents from its layout rules and publishing. The general concept is to use established tools and processes from software development and apply them in the creation of documents. At ASAM, the main aspects of this concept are: Writing documents in plain text markup Using repositories with version control systems Collaborating on projects through online repository platforms Automation of repetitive steps using automation pipelines At ASAM, the central aspect of this concept is the usage of plain text documents with a semantic markup language in creating standards and other documents, particularly the free AsciiDoc format. Its main benefit is the separation of content from style and layout rules, making it possible to specify general layout settings in a separate set of files and instructions for consistency over multiple projects. Another benefit is that AsciiDoc files can be opened and edited with any type of text editor, making it a platform-agnostic format. Different people can write content independent of the operating system on their work devices or requiring specific software licenses. Finally, the content is decoupled from the target output, making it easy to generate different types of documentation from the same source files. AsciiDoc source file Rendered output Figure 1. ASAM Foreword section in AsciiDoc (source) Figure 2. The same Foreword section rendered by Asciidoctor and Antora in HTML (rich output) Using tool-supported document versioning is another main aspect in the Doc-as-Code approach. ASAM projects use the software Git for this purpose. It allows for working on different parts, features, or versions of a project separately. With Git, all separately developed parts can be merged again later. Content is stored in so-called repositories. Each repository consist of one or more branches. At ASAM, there usually is one main branch (called \"main\" or (outdated) \"master\") and possibly one or more feature branches. The central branch (also called the \"trunk\") acts as the agreed or released \"official\" state of the repository. When a change needs to be made, they are added through branches created from this trunk. Each child branch targets a single aspect of development. Once the development in a child branch has advanced enough, it’s changes are merged back into the trunk. This is done through a so-called Merge Request (MR), sometimes called a Pull Request (PR) instead. Figure 3. Repository workflow and branching example. If you want to learn more about Git itself, ASAM recommends online introductions and tutorials such as this one. Contributing at ASAM is easy: you only need a web browser! The work on standards, particularly at ASAM, is of collaborative nature: People from different companies companies join in a project to develop something together. Online repository platforms like GitLab and GitHub support the collaboration by providing features for commenting and reviewing content changes as well as issue boards for creating and tracking topics. In addition to that, they also integrate the same versioning and repository aspects described in the section above. Using online collaboration platforms with repository support provide multiple benefits: They typically provide online editors for content, so users can choose to participate in projects without having to install software (besides any standard web browser) Merge Requests (Pull Requests) can be reviewed and commented on with a side-by-side preview in the browser (diff view) They act as central repository location for the project(s) that can be accessed from anywhere (provided the user has sufficient rights), so all involved people always have access to the latest submitted changes They enable central automation steps through CI/CD pipelines, for example automated writing rules checks on a document after it was updated Integrated issue boards for keeping track of tasks, found problems, discussion topics, etc. The figure below shows an example issue from a project where a topic discussion takes place. Figure 4. Example for a topic discussion through the GitLab issue board in a project ASAM currently supports projects on both its internal GitLab instance as well as on the public GitHub. Each project can decide independently which platform it will use. GitLab is the most commonly used platform right now at ASAM. Pipelines in online repositories allow to automate repetitive steps, such as building a document and checking for structural and grammatical errors. ASAM projects typically automate the following steps: Convert AsciiDoc files to html using Asciidoctor or Antora Linting and testing documents for rules defined in the ASAM editorial guide and returning found errors Publishing results as pipeline artifacts for downloads or distribution Running project-specific scripts for additional features, such as converting uml diagrams to AsciiDoc files These pipeline instructions are stored in text files in each repository. In GitLab, they are stored as .gitlab-ci.yml. In GitHub, they are stored as \"workflows\" under .github/workflows. In both cases, the file is written in \"YAML\". If you want to learn more about pipelines, see the GitLab CI documentation or the GiHub blog.","title":"Documentation as Code","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"doc-as-code","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/concepts/doc-as-code.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Concept","hash":"_concept","id":2},{"text":"Plain text content files","hash":"sec-plain-text-markup","id":3},{"text":"Versioning and repositories","hash":"sec-versioning-repo","id":4},{"text":"Online collaboration","hash":"sec-online-collaboration","id":5},{"text":"Automation pipelines","hash":"sec-automation-pipeline","id":6}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"This page describes the structure of standards documents and the types of standards that are produced in projects. Standards can consist of several parts. These parts are independent and must each individually comply with the basic document structure for ASAM standards. Each standard contains exactly one Specification. It defines the syntax, abstract models, and functionality for general use. The Specification is defined in a technology-independent form. It is normative by default. The document may contain non-normative content as long as it is clearly marked as such. A standard may contain one or more Reference documents. A Reference contains information for implementers of this standard. It provides additional information to the Specification in regards to implementing this standard. This information is non-normative. A standard may contain one or more Guideline documents. A Guideline contains information for users of this standard. It provides additional information to the Specification in regards to applying and using this standard, such as specific content examples. This information is non-normative. Sometimes, a project’s delivery does not fit either of the above. In this case, the project may contain additional, so-called \"Supplementary\", material. Note that Supplemental material is only allowed if deemed absolutely necessary and if it is neither Specification, Reference, nor Guideline. If you are unsure into which category a certain topic falls, you can ask your ASAM Office Responsible. ASAM provides a template for creating an ASAM specification. It contains all mandatory sections and text blocks. A style sheet defines an identical look & feel for all ASAM standards. For new projects, ASAM creates a new document from a template.

The icons are explained in the project types Ideation Proposal Development Review Release Purpose To decide whether an idea for a project is promising. Required for Any project not directly based on a previous project. If someone has an idea for a new standard, it triggers the ideation phase for a new project. During this phase, the idea is evaluated and fleshed out a bit until it is either discarded (e.g. it is not feasible or a duplicate of sorts) or accepted. In case the idea is accepted, the project moves on to the Proposal phase. Additional information Ideation phase Purpose To define funding and participants for a project and decide whether to proceed. Required for Every project type. Whether a project idea was just accepted or an improvement or update on an existing standard was proposed, the project enters the Proposal Phase. During this phase, a Proposal document is generated, detailing the project’s targets, participants, the budget, timeline, and other project-related information. The Project Type is also specified during this phase. With this document, the ASAM TSC decides if the project may continue or not. If the go-ahead is given, the project continues on to the [Development phase]. Additional information Proposal phase Purpose To develop the project’s deliverables. Required for Every project type. This is the main phase of each project. During this phase, the project-type specific deliverables are developed by the project participants. In the beginning, the project team organizes a workshop to specify their modus operandi and set up all technical aspects of the project. This is followed by specifying, writing, and reviewing content internally until the document or documents are ready for a ASAM-internal or public review in the [Review phase]. Additional information getting-involved:development_phase.adoc Purpose To review the developed deliverables. Required for Major Version Update Minor Version Update Before they are officially released, the created deliverables are to be reviewed. Depending on the project, these reviews may be available to ASAM members only, free for the public, or a mixture of both. Any problems that are identified during any of these reviews are then analyzed and categorized. Important fixes have to be made before the deliverables are released, whilst improvements beyond the initial scope or minute details may be put off for future iterations. Additional information Review phase Purpose To release the developed deliverables. Required for Every project type. After the deliverables have been developed and (optionally) successfully reviewed by the TSC, they are released to the public. The project has now concluded.

ASAM developes its products and results in projects. Different result types require different approaches and conditions. For this reason, ASAM defines four project types, which further characterize the work to be done within the projects. They are: Concept Standard development Study Implementation Figure 1. ASAM project types overview A new project can be triggered by either a new idea, a previous Concept Paper, or a previously released Standard. The intended output of each project type is a document. For a Concept project, the output is a Concept Paper (which can be the basis for a follow-up project) For a Standard Development project, the output is the standard + optional supplemental documents For a Study project, the output is a Study Report that details the findings of the project. For an Implementation project, the output is TODO. Note that a new concept project is usually not triggered by a previous one. Description Concept projects have the purpose to prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards. They are typically chosen when the envisioned standard is complex and requires significant resources to even develop a sound and solid project proposal. Goal The goals of concept projects are to propose specific content for ASAM standards and/or to provide justification for the usefulness, practicability, and feasibility of the proposed content. Repository suffix Concept More details Table 1. Summary Purpose Create a new project proposal for complex topics Funding Limit 75% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase For more details, see Concept project in the Compendium. Major version update Minor version update Maintenance A major version development project is a new standard or a project that introduces significant changes to an existing standard, e.g. the addition of a new major feature or significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor. A minor version development project introduces changes to existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. A maintenance version development project resolves technical issues of the standard, i.e. corrects errors, removes ambiguities, adds clarifications to existing descriptions, makes editorial improvements or changes examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. A new maintenance version of an ASAM standard is always backward-compatible. Description Standard development projects are the core of ASAM. In these, Sub-group members define the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated). Goal The goal is to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. Repository suffix Standard All variants use the same repository suffix. For more details, see Standard Development project in the Compendium. Description Study projects provide members, an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards in a collaborative way. Goal These projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards, to promote their application in member companies, and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards.

Each of these roles has their own set of requirements, mandatory and/or optional tool, guidelines and how-tos, some of them shared between multiple roles. Figure 1. Overview over the most relevant roles in ASAM projects. It is possible to have more than one role at the same time. Some roles require you to \"enroll in a project\" first. You can learn more about this process on the page Signing up for projects. The following table contains a list of the most prominent roles at ASAM and a short description for each of them. Click on a role’s label to navigate directly to the role’s summary page. Table 1. List of roles Outside roles (1) Someone who has access to and possibly is an active user of any ASAM standard. Some standards require ASAM membership in order to access the documents, whilst other standards are available to anyone online. The role Standard User is not directly involved in the creation of a standard. However, a Standard User may take over other (active) roles in a project by enrolling in it. Note that project participation also requires ASAM membership! (2) An ASAM member outside the project that participates in the review of one or more documents. When a project’s deliverables are reviewed, ASAM members who were not involved in the project directly can participate in the Review phase by becoming a Reviewer and providing feedback. Project roles (3) An ASAM member active in an ASAM project. Each project consists of multiple Project Participants who directly contribute to the project’s development. Most participants typically enroll during the Proposal phase, but it also possible to already participate during the Ideation phase. Typically, Project Participants work in one or more so-called Sub-groups, each focussing on a specific aspect of the project. (4) The Project Participant responsible for the project and leading the general project activities. Every project needs one elected Project Lead who takes responsibility for it. The Project Lead is elected at the beginning of the getting-involved:development_phase.adoc. Any Project Participant can send in their candidacy during the Proposal phase. (5) A Project Participant leading the activities of a Sub-group. Many projects divide up their activities into so-called Sub-groups which focus on specific aspects of a project. Each of these groups may be led by a Sub-group Lead. Supporting roles (6) ASAM contact of the project. A OR is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project. (7) Editor and writing support. A Technical Writer supports the creation of documents. They ensure ASAM’s Editorial Guide is applied and the document is formalized. (8) Committee at ASAM reviewing a project’s state. The TSC is responsible for approving or rejecting budgets, projects and proposals as well as releases of project results, such as standards or concept papers.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label {requiresClarification-label} to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label {isStatusDuplicate-label} and assign the SUBGROUP LEAD The SG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to {requiresClarification-label} and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to {requiresConceptualWork-label} to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch Review implementation progress of issue with SUBGROUP LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Sub-group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to {requiresCCBReview-label} If changes were marked as draft, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to {isStatusWontBeFixed-label} and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident. The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'.

The guidelines apply to every project level meeting (where the whole project is invited) and all Sub-group meetings (where the whole Sub-group is invited). These are considered official meetings in this context. Clarification or co-development calls as well as similar informal types of meetings do not have to follow these guidelines. They still may if they wish, of course. If you are hosting an official meeting, make sure to familiarize yourself with them ahead of time. An official meeting will not take place unless a minute taker is defined in advance! Project meetings are set up by the ASAM office, even when they are not the meeting host. All other meetings within a project (such as Sub-group meetings) have to be set up by the respective host. Every meeting has a host. This is the person who calls the meeting. The host has the following responsibilities: Define the minute taker. They can take that role themselves if they wish. If not, the assignee has to agree to this task first. Provide the agenda for the meeting Set up the meeting and send out the invites (exception: project meetings are set up by the ASAM office in coordination with the host) Moderate the meeting Ensure to stay within the defined timetable If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants (assignees) Ensure that minutes are taken and send out the link to them afterwards Follow up with assignees on assigned tasks after the meeting The minute taker is designated by the meeting host. This may be the host themselves. However, the host may not just appoint role to a project member without their consent. The order of responsibility regarding the taking of minutes is as follows: Host (since they usually do not need to travel) Service Provider Project Lead Office Responsible The minute taker has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Create the meeting notes document ahead of time Add the provided agenda to the meeting notes During the meeting Document the participants as well as missing meeting members Take notes during the meeting Document all assigned tasks with their assignees Add provided links and documents After the meeting Request missing documents and links from the responsible participants Update the notes with delivered updates (e.g. links to files) Finalize the notes once everything has been provided Inform the host in case of overdue tasks The host of the meeting is responsible for providing a meeting agenda ahead of time. The agenda must be shared in the invite to the meeting. The agenda also has to be included in the meeting notes. Each agenda must at least have the following contents: Antitrust Reminder scheduled votes for the meeting documentation of participants voting template agenda items The target audience depends on your meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR. The OpenX Calendar The list of project participants can be found in the project’s participant list. This list also contains information on the group or groups each participant is part of. Feel free to use whatever solution you or your company normally use. If your company does not provide you with a suitable solution, send the details to your ASAM representative and they will assist (either with Teams or Zoom). Meetings are the default way of taking project- or Sub-group-level polls. Their results have to be made available in the corresponding meeting notes. By default, polls are announced in the agenda (before the meeting takes place). However, if spontaneous topics arise, ad hoc polls can be held if all impacted participants are present. In case one or more crucial members for a topic’s ad hoc poll are missing, the poll has to be postponed and scheduled for the next meeting instead. A poll is only valid if at least 50% of registered active (sub-)group members cast their vote and the Issue Responsible (if defined) is present. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. A passive participant (someone not involved in the development directly) is neither considered for this threshold nor may they participate in any polls. To be eligible for casting a vote, a member has to have been present during the corresponding topic discussion/presentation. The only exception to this is voting for topics of static nature, such as meeting frequencies. All votes must be cast digitally and through an online tool (so both onsite and remote users can vote). ASAM recommends the use of \"Microsoft Forms\" in case of online voting. You can ask your ASAM Office Responsible for support on creating such a vote ahead of time. Do a quick vote first (e.g. show of hands). If it is unanimous, you can skip the formal process of voting. Make sure to document the result in either case, however. In a project-level meeting, each company has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all participating companies. It is recommended that if a company has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a company casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally), their vote is counted as abstention. In a Sub-group meeting, each participant has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all Sub-group members. This is independent of company affiliation. Meeting notes (minutes) are to be taken in the project’s repository. The repository contains a template for meeting notes that shall be used. The designated minute taker is responsible for taking the notes. The notes must contain all important decisions (including cast votes). Additionally, the next scheduled meeting shall be listed here as well.

It is the responsibility of the Project Lead to keep this document up to date on at least a monthly basis. They may delegate this task to another project member.","title":"Sharepoint structure","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"teams_and_sharepoint","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/contributing/teams_and_sharepoint.html","titles":[{"text":"What Sharepoint is used for","hash":"_what_sharepoint_is_used_for","id":1},{"text":"What Sharepoint is NOT used for","hash":"_what_sharepoint_is_not_used_for","id":2},{"text":"Participants list","hash":"_participants_list","id":3}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"ASAM recommends to hold a project-level meeting at least once a quarter. A full project meeting is used to hold project level votes, align across Sub-groups and evaluate the overall status with respect to the project plan. The group can decide to combine these with the Cycle Review meetings since most aspects of a project-level meeting coincides with those of a Cycle Review. However, if a Cycle takes longer than 3 months, ASAM recommends having a separate project-level meeting in between. Each project at ASAM is also part of an overarching project coordination. This coordination includes different monitoring and steering meetings. It is the Project Lead’s responsibility to represent their project in those meetings. Simulation domain projects are required to participate in the following external ASAM meetings: CGSim controlling meetings TSC controlling meetings Figure 1. Medium length development project example, including cycle details and external ASAM controlling meetings. The Coordination Group Simulation (CGSim) controlling meetings are the default reporting location for development projects. Here, each project presents their current status regularly (after every cycle). If a project is behind schedule or faces unpredicted problems and setbacks, or if the project’s scope needs to be altered significantly, the project status is escalated at the next TSC controlling meeting. The Project Lead discusses these topics with the project’s ASAM Office Responsible to decide whether they need to be escalated to the TSC and, if so, how. These are the top level controlling meetings at ASAM, where the TSC reviews all current projects. Here, projects can request more time as well as submit their deliverables for review and, ideally, approval for release. In case a project faces unforeseen problems and setbacks, these are addressed here as well after having been presented at a preceding CGSim controlling meeting. If you are interested, the ASAM Website provides some more information on the whole development process. Check out the Development Process page. If you have additional questions, don’t hesitate to contact your ASAM representative. Under the following instances must a topic be presented at the next project-level meeting: * Changes to the underlying data model * It is requested by the Sub-group * It is requested by the Project Lead * It is requested by a project steering committee (e.g. the CCB) * The Sub-group cannot reach a decision on a specific topic or assumes that there are different opinions in the overall project group The Project Lead may escalate Sub-group decisions to a project level vote. If a project cannot meet its milestones or budget, it must escalate its status report in the next CGSim controlling meeting. See also CGSim controlling meetings above. An inactive participant is someone who is registered as an active participant but repeatedly and unexcused does not partake in meetings or any development activities. How \"repeatedly unexcused\" absent a participant has to be before being marked as inactive is up to the project to decide. As an example, a group can decide that three (3) unexcused absences are the limit, with a final warning being issued after the second time. Inactive participants can hinder a project by bringing it below the required voting threshold. They also put more workload on the other active members. It is, therefore, important to identify inactive members quickly and get them to be active again. As a last resort, inactive (and possibly unresponsive) members can be removed from the project. This is the responsibility of the responsible lead: Project Lead for project level inactiveness, Sub-group Lead for relevant sub-groups. Typically, identification of inactive participants is tied to meeting participation. The respective Lead must contact members that have been identified as inactive to try and get them involved (again). If this fails, the inactive member can be removed from the project either through the project controlling or, in difficult cases, through the TSC.","title":"Development phase meetings","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"development_phase_meetings","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/getting-involved/development_phase_meetings.html","titles":[{"text":"Project-level meetings","hash":"_project_level_meetings","id":1},{"text":"External ASAM meetings","hash":"_external_asam_meetings","id":2},{"text":"CGSim controlling meetings","hash":"_cgsim_controlling_meetings","id":3},{"text":"TSC controlling meetings","hash":"_tsc_controlling_meetings","id":4},{"text":"Information online","hash":"_information_online","id":5},{"text":"Escalation of topics","hash":"_escalation_of_topics","id":6},{"text":"From Sub-group to group","hash":"_from_sub_group_to_group","id":7},{"text":"From group to TSC","hash":"_from_group_to_tsc","id":8},{"text":"Inactive participants","hash":"_inactive_participants","id":9}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"This page describes how developing a standard works at ASAM. It describes mandatory, typical, and recommended steps of the Development phase. Please note that in order for a project to enter this phase, its proposal has to have been approved by the TSC. The process of developing a standard at ASAM starts with a project setup step, which is followed by the development cycle. The Development phase ends at the date set in the project’s milestone plan. At this point, the project transitions to the next phase, which typically is the Review phase. Figure 1. Examples for a typcial Development phase timeline: short (6 months), medium (12 months), long (18 months). The cycle reviews should be timed such that each of them occurs at least two weeks prior to the respectively next TSC controlling meeting. This ensures that the Project Lead will have enough time to prepare a status report based on the latest review for these meetings. The initiation of the Development phase is the setup step, particularly the Kick-off Workshop, hosted by ASAM and announced on the ASAM Website as well as on other platforms. Here, the project team is brought up to speed. This is also the last chance for the project group to take on additional members. The project group may vote on extending this deadline past the Kick-off Workshop if substantial reasons for doing so exist. The team also defines the project parameters that have not been defined during the Proposal phase. Lastly, the project team elects a Project Lead who takes responsibility for the project and its coordination with the ASAM office. The group also defines other roles, such as the members of the Change Control Board (CCB) and the Sub-group Leads. The results from this meeting are then applied to the project’s repository, which is set up in the background by ASAM. Some projects require external help for certain tasks. In this case (and if the Project Proposal contained a budget for it), the project prepares a request for offers in the Kick-off Workshop. It then sends out the request to hire one or more qualified service providers. The ASAM office assists the project group with this process. The offer submission period lasts 6 weeks. The ASAM office then provides the Project Lead with all the offers (prices redacted) so they can evaluate and prioritizes them together with the project group. The evaluated list (including prices) is then presented to the TSC which then makes the final decision on whom to hire (vote by email). The contract with the service provider is set up by the ASAM Office. All in all, the process of hiring a service provider takes at least 8 weeks. The project lead MAY NOT be a service provider! Once the project is set up, the first development cycle can commence. At this point, the project has an elected project lead Sub-groups, if required elected or selected Sub-group leads that are responsible for certain focus points of the project’s topics, its own project repository (or repositories), complete with README, timeline, and pre-configured pipeline, where all members have been granted access to a mailing list with all its members a Microsoft Sharepoint structure agreed and documented Development phase parameters, such as cycle duration agreed and documented project milestones (at least the first two of which have to already be detailed) if required: contracts with one or more service providers or, if this process takes longer, ongoing activities for hiring one or more service providers This is where the standard is being developed. This part of the Development phase consists of multiple cycles. Each cycle is structured the same way, with some events occurring only in some of these cycles. These will be detailed below. To learn more about how you can contribute to this phase, check out the pages on how to start contributing. ASAM recommends a 2 month interval per Development cycle. The project team may define a different cycle length, if necessary. However, it must then also ensure that cycles are then still aligned with external ASAM events, particularly the [TSC controlling meetings] and the [CGSim controlling meetings]. It is also recommended for all recurring meetings to have intervals of 6-8 weeks or less. Each development cycle starts with a Cycle Planning. Here, the Project Lead defines the goals for the cycle together with the members of the CCB and the Sub-group Leads. The decisions are then passed on to the other project members and the service provider(s). If the project is currently employing a Technical Writer, they are also informed accordingly. It is recommended to balance assignments as much as possible amongst the active participants. This is an official meeting hosted by the Project Lead. Make sure to follow the ASAM meeting guidelines. After the goals for the cycle have been defined, the team contributes to achieving these goals. Depending on their role, this may be creating new issues to initiate discussions and reach decisions on topics participating in the discussions within such issues creating and uploading reference and additional materials such as images transforming agreed issue content into document files (AsciiDoc) As mentioned above, a standard cycle takes 2 months by default. Each Sub-group may decide to have one or more internal meetings per cycle. ASAM recommends to have at least one group meeting every second week. If so, these are considered official meetings and hosted by the respective Sub-group Lead. Make sure to follow the ASAM meeting guidelines. Informal calls and ad hoc meetings between group members are not considered official and do not have to follow the provided guidelines. At the end of each cycle, the results are reviewed by the team. Each Sub-group presents its results to its Sub-group Lead. Each Sub-group Lead then presents their group’s status to the other Sub-group Leads, the CCB, and the Project Lead. This will then form the basis for the decisions in the next Cycle Planning. These reports will also be used to communicate the project’s overall progress and status in the [TSC controlling meetings] and the [CGSim controlling meetings]. The controlling meetings are attended by the Project Lead when they occur. Note that the frequency of these controlling meetings is typically different from that of the Development cycles. However, the 2 month cycle proposed by ASAM can be easily aligned with both the CGSim and the TSC meetings. These are official meetings. Each Sub-group Review meeting is hosted by the respective Sub-group Lead. The project’s Cycle Review meeting is hosted by the Project Lead. Make sure to follow the ASAM meeting guidelines. Defining all variables at the beginning of a project that takes months to complete is necessary to get started. However, experience shows that things change or become more clear with time passing. This is why ASAM strongly recommends to do a so-called retrospective at the end of each cycle. It is similar to the Cycle Review, but instead of content it focusses on processes and the development environment. A retrospective is a meeting where a team reflects their last development cycle (often also referred to as \"sprints\") and tries to identify the things that really help or hinder the project right now. The goal is to then take measures to keep the good things and find better solutions or approaches where sinkholes and problems have been identified. The whole team is encouraged to participate and every voice is to be heard. The retrospective gives the team a tool to gradually and iteratively improve their processes and workflows. Ideally, this also pushes motivation in the team and increases the team’s cohesion. If you want to learn more about retrospectives and how they work, there are lots of pages online for the retrospective in Agile processes such as SCRUM. Some examples: https://backlog.com/blog/three-ways-run-productive-retrospective/ https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective For input regarding possible activities during these retrospectives, you can turn to this very helpful online tool: https://retromat.org/ This is an official meeting. The project may decide whether to have a fixed host or change the assignee/host regularly. Make sure to follow the ASAM meeting guidelines. Rare is the project that does not change its shape during development. However, not every change can be made without a formal change process. All changes that affect the project scope require a formal Change Request (CR). If a scope-changing issue is entered after the project has started, this is considered a Change Request. The requirements for these issues is identical to every other feature issue. The project group will decide whether the CR is accepted or rejected. If it is accepted, it is assigned (project member or Sub-group). With that, the standard Contribution Workflow applies.

This document is submitted to the ASAM Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for approval. On approval, the next project phase (the Development Phase) can begin. Figure 1. The Proposal phase timeline In this phase, the proposed idea is further analyzed. In the Proposal document, central requirements are formulated, the expected effort is quantified, and the timeline is specified. In addition to that interested parties can enroll during this phase for project participation, the proposal is released to attract more attention as well as for transparency. The Proposal document is then submitted and presented to the TSC for approval. Submittal must occur at least two (2) weeks prior to the TSC meeting. If the Project Proposal is approved, the project transitions to the Standard Development phase. Otherwise, the TSC outlines the aspects that need to be revised prior to another submission.

Responsible PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT Involved OFFICE RESPONSIBLE The project group prepares a release candidate and agrees per formal voting to submit the candidate to the TSC for release decision. Each company has one vote. The release candidate is accepted by absolute two-thirds majority. The group’s decision is documented in the meeting minutes. The Project Leader submits the following deliverables to ASAM: the standard with all supplemental documents, files and examples that constitute the deliverables to members sources required to generate the deliverables, including written instructions how to generate them revision history documentation (not needed for version 1.0.0) a (new) release presentation Sources are those digital work products, which can be modified or edited with standard tools such as text editors, image processors or modeling tools, and which are the input for generators that produce the final deliverables. The release candidate has to be submitted at least two (2) weeks prior to the next TSC meeting. Purpose To review the deliverables, to clarify open questions, and to come to an individual conclusion about the release-worthiness of the release candidate. Responsible TSC MEMBER Involved OFFICE RESPONSIBLE The TSC members review the release with special focus on the changes. They shall clarify open question with the Project Leader prior to the TSC meeting. TSC members shall make up their mind whether the release candidate is ready for publication. The minimum review period for release candidates is four weeks. Purpose To approve or reject the release candidate. Responsible TSC MEMBER Involved PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SUBGROUP LEAD Decisions on release candidates are put on the agenda of the next available TSC meeting. Release candidate decisions are handled during the meeting via a three-step process: Project leader presents the release candidate to the TSC members. TSC members are given the opportunity to ask questions. TSC members discuss the proposal (without Project Leader’s presence) and then proceed with casting their votes on the release. The TSC does not modify the content of the release candidate. If this is deemed to be necessary, then the release shall be rejected. The voting is carried out in accordance with the TSC voting rules. The Board Representative for the TSC has to confirm the TSC decision. The TSC may add requirements for rework of the release candidate and make the release contingent upon the completion of the required rework. The Office shall check the reworked release candidate submission. If the required rework has been implemented as defined by the TSC, then the release is effective and the release process continues.

The goal is to increase the overall quality and acceptance of the standard prior to its release. The project group can (and should!) review their changes regularly during development. The Review phase is a dedicated \"final\" review phase before publication. Figure 1. The Review phase All deliverables of the standard shall be feature-complete, i.e. the specification or revision of all features of the standard has been finished. A partial review of a deliverable (where the deliverable is incomplete) is prohibited! The project group members determine whether the standard is ready for the review phase. Figure 2. The Review phase timeline Purpose To obtain technical review feedback from the project group. Responsible Project group Involved Project group The Project Lead initiates the internal review process. The Project Group reviews the deliverables and provides feedback. The default review period for outside reviews is 3 weeks. If a project groups has reasons to skip the project group review entirely, it must get approval from the ASAM Office Responsible, the Project Lead, and the ASAM CTO first. Purpose To review and decide upon the reviewers' feedback and to incorporate corresponding changes to the draft standard. Responsible Project group Involved Members The project group has the obligation to review each review feedback and make a decision on how to further work on it. The decision includes as a minimum the status \"accepted\", \"rejected\" or \"deferred\". The decision must be documented. Accepted feedback shall be implemented. The project group has full authority how to implement the reviewers' feedback into the standard. They can implement changes as proposed by the reviewer, or decide for a different implementation. If a reviewer’s feedback is actually out-of-scope, since it contains a request to consider a new use-case, feature or requirement, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the ASAM CR-system with status \"new\". The project group members have the obligation to review each comment and make a decision. The project group has full authority to decide, how to handle a comment, e.g. to accept, modify, defer or reject comments, and to make corresponding changes to the standard at their own discretion. The default feedback implementation period for group reviews is 2 weeks. If no major setbacks have been identified, the outside review is started. Otherwise, the project will do another group review. Purpose To create a preliminary version of the standard for carrying out an outside review. Responsible Project Lead Involved Office The Project Lead is responsible for delivering the draft document(s) in a format which is usable in the ASAM IT infrastructure for document reviews. Changes to the prior version shall be marked in the draft documents or documented in a separate changelog, with clear references to the draft documents. The Office publishes the start of the outside review process via newsletter and ASAM website, and provides additional information, such as a brief description of the changes in the standard, review process steps and the review deadline. Outside reviews are mandatory for development projects of major versions. The project group releases a draft of the standard, which is feature-complete and has undergone an internal review. A review of an incomplete set of deliverables is not allowed by default. The ASAM Office Responsible and the ASAM CTO can make an exception for a project upon request by the Project Lead. This exception must be provided in written form. However, each of the provided deliverables still has to be feature-complete. Purpose To obtain technical review feedback from members. Responsible Members Involved Office Responsible, project group The Office provides an IT solution for carrying out the outside review of the draft. The Office provides technical support for reviewers and ensures that review feedback is accessible to the project group members in a timely manner. There are two types of outside reviews: * ASAM member reviews (default) * Public reviews ASAM member reviews are the default type of outside reviews at ASAM. In general, every ASAM member can download the draft standard and participate in the review. The Office may restrict the group of reviewers in agreement with the project group members or as per TSC decision. In a public review, the draft standard is made publicly available without the requirement of being an ASAM member. Only standards that are not going to be sold by ASAM are eligible for a public review with non-members. Members of the project group are available to answer technical questions from reviewers. Reviewers should not submit new use-cases, features, or requirements as part of their review feedback. The Office asks the reviewers to submit such requests via the regular ASAM CR system. Any incorrectly submitted change requests of this sort can be dismissed or added to a backlog for future versions by the project group. The default review period for outside reviews is 3 weeks. Purpose To end the public review and have all feedback ready for the next process step. Responsible Office Involved none The Office terminates the outside review of the draft process by: removing the draft standard download from the ASAM website. closing the IT-solution to accept further review feedback. Once the review period is over, the ASAM office removes the draft standard from public access and makes the review comments available to the project group. Purpose To review and decide upon the reviewers' feedback and to incorporate corresponding changes to the draft standard. Responsible Project group Involved Members The rules for the processing of outside feedback is identical to the Group feedback processing, with the following addition: ASAM has the obligation to inform reviewers about the status of their review feedback, upon their request.

The enrollment process starts with the Proposal Workshop. Ideation Proposal and Development You are interested in a proposed idea and want to join in its discussions and possible the following Proposal phase? Follow the steps below. You have signed up for updates and events around the idea. You must be an ASAM member or be sponsored by one Send an email to the address listed on the idea page The ASAM Office (OR) will send you a confirmation Also see the ASAM website for more information. You are interested in joining an ASAM project for active development? Follow the steps below. You have signed up for and committed to the chosen project. You must be an ASAM member to join a project Your commitment must be at least 50% of the project group’s average Enrollment is possible in the period between the Proposal Workshop and the Kick-off Workshop. In case you need to join after this period, contact the ASAM office. The ASAM CTO can make an exception if the reasons for joining after the fact are sufficiently important. The same is true if you cannot commit the required amount. Contact the ASAM office (through the project’s proposal webpage) with your request to enroll Enclose all mandatory information in the contact form Consider the provided minimal and recommended minimum contribution You will receive a confirmation In case your project commitment is below the minimum value, you will be contacted by the office to check if you will increase your commitment or withdraw your enrollment If a member intends to commit a work effort of less than 50% of the average of the work efforts committed by all other project group members, then the Office can deny the registration. The member or the office can escalate the issue to the TSC. If you want to, you can also submit your candidacy for leader roles in a project you want to participate in. Candidates are elected during the Kick-off Workshop of a project. Interested people can submit their candidacy for the following roles: Project Lead Sub-group Lead","title":"Signing up for projects","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"signing_up","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/getting-involved/signing_up.html","titles":[{"text":"Where you can participate","hash":"_where_you_can_participate","id":1},{"text":"Who can sign up","hash":"_who_can_sign_up","id":2},{"text":"When to sign up","hash":"_when_to_sign_up","id":3},{"text":"How to sign up","hash":"_how_to_sign_up","id":4},{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":5},{"text":"Result","hash":"_result","id":6},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites-idea-submittal","id":7},{"text":"How","hash":"_how","id":8},{"text":"Context","hash":"_context_2","id":9},{"text":"Result","hash":"_result_2","id":10},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":11},{"text":"How","hash":"_how_2","id":12},{"text":"Special roles","hash":"_special_roles","id":13}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"TODO","title":"Change Control Board member","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"ccb-member","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/role-specific/ccb-member.html","titles":[]},"34":{"id":34,"text":"Get to know your role(s) and responsibilities.

List of roles Outside roles (1) Someone who has access to and possibly is an active user of any ASAM standard. Some standards require ASAM membership in order to access the documents, whilst other standards are available to anyone online. The role Standard User is not directly involved in the creation of a standard. However, a Standard User may take over other (active) roles in a project by enrolling in it. Note that project participation also requires ASAM membership! (2) An ASAM member outside the project that participates in the review of one or more documents. When a project’s deliverables are reviewed, ASAM members who were not involved in the project directly can participate in the Review phase by becoming a Reviewer and providing feedback. Project roles (3) An ASAM member active in an ASAM project. Each project consists of multiple Project Participants who directly contribute to the project’s development. Most participants typically enroll during the Proposal phase, but it also possible to already participate during the Ideation phase. Typically, Project Participants work in one or more so-called Sub-groups, each focussing on a specific aspect of the project. (4) The Project Participant responsible for the project and leading the general project activities. Every project needs one elected Project Lead who takes responsibility for it. The Project Lead is elected at the beginning of the getting-involved:development_phase.adoc. Any Project Participant can send in their candidacy during the Proposal phase. (5) A Project Participant leading the activities of a Sub-group. Many projects divide up their activities into so-called Sub-groups which focus on specific aspects of a project. Each of these groups may be led by a Sub-group Lead. Supporting roles (6) ASAM contact of the project. A OR is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project. (7) Editor and writing support. A Technical Writer supports the creation of documents. They ensure ASAM’s Editorial Guide is applied and the document is formalized. (8) Committee at ASAM reviewing a project’s state. The TSC is responsible for approving or rejecting budgets, projects and proposals as well as releases of project results, such as standards or concept papers.","title":"ASAM roles","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"main","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/role-specific/main.html","titles":[]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"An OR (Office Responsible) is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project.

Proper modal verbs Level of obligation Verb to use Colloquial meaning Requirement shall, shall not mandatory statement, \"it must do/have\", \"it is not allowed to do/have\" Recommendation should, should not \"it is good/bad practice to do/have\" Permission may, need not \"it is allowed to do/have and also allowed not to do/have\" Possibility can, cannot \"it depends on some circumstances if or if not\" The differences between these verbs are subtle and sometimes difficult to grasp. The table with modal verbs is based on ISO guidelines but currently under discussion. It is possible that the table will be simplified in the future. Write short sentences. If sentences get too long, consider splitting them up into shorter sentences. Keep headings short (only one line). Table 3. Shortness is key No Yes 3.1 Hints on how to maintain the printer 3.1 Printer maintenance Due to the fact that they were able to come to an agreement, a name changing of the file took place.

The vehicle, which is red, drives down the road. Stick to one spelling for a word that allows several spellings (e-mail, email, E-mail). Stick to one style to present information (steps always as numbered lists). Stick to one formatting for a special purpose (first use of technical term: italic) Adoc-templates are available for common types of topics. Use them to create consistent content. Each template contains instructions on how to use the template and sample text that has to be replaced. Currently available templates: Generic Task UML element Use case Insert a line break after each sentence. No manual line breaks inside sentences. ⇒ \"Only hit 'enter' after a period ('.'), but make sure to hit 'enter' after a period.\" 1 This is the first sentence. 2 This is the second sentence. 3 This is the third sentence. Use paragraphs to structure your text. A new thought or statement requires a new paragraph. An empty line creates a new paragraph. 1 This is the first sentence of the first paragraph. 2 This is the second sentence of the first paragraph. 3 4 This is the first sentence of the second paragraph. In headings and captions, only the first word begins with an uppercase letter (sentence-style capitalization). Exception: Acronyms and proper names are spelled as is. Table 10.

No Yes Normal text →Level 1 indented text →→Level 2 indented text Normal text …​.Level 1 indented text …​…​..Level 2 indented text All topics, figures, tables and code examples shall have a unique tag. Sections may also have a tag if a link to the section is needed. Note: If you cannot come up with a document-wide unique id, just add [#tag-uid]. This triggers a pipeline warning and the Technical Writer can help you. Examples: [#top-uid] [#fig-uid] [#tab-uid] [#code-uid] [#sec-uid] You can generate a UUID using a generator like https://www.uuidgenerator.net/. Text sections (paragraphs or blocks of text) in the documentation of a standard are considered normative. If some text sections should be considered as non-normative and only descriptive (for example, background information or examples), mark this sections deliberately as non-normative. Non-normative sections shall be marked with the user-defined asciidoc role non-normative. Put the role attribute [.non-normative] in front of single paragraphs or blocks to mark them as non-normative. Inside a normative section use [.non-normative]## to mark single text passages as non-normative. Example for normative and non-normative sections This is a normative paragraph. [.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph. ==== This is a normative block. ==== [.non-normative] ==== This is a descriptive block. ==== This is another normative paragraph. This sentence is normative. [.non-normative]#This sentence is non-normative.# This sentence is normative again. Roles can be combined using the following syntax: [..]. Example with multiple roles [.important.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph that is also marked with the important-role. Id and role attributes can be combined. Use the long notation for easier reading: [id=, role=]. Example with role and id combined [id=top-doc-unique-id, role=non-normative] = Document title This is a descriptive, non-normative document. The actual format and style of non-normative sections depends on the entry in the CSS style sheet file that is used for rendering the text and is not coded in the adoc-file itself. Example of a CSS entry for non-normative text .non-normative { font-style: italic; color: darkgreen; background: gold } Lists are a great way to present lots of similar information in a compact form. Use the same word/sentence structure for all list items. Use numbered lists (Asciidoc '.') for steps that require a specific order. Use bullet points (Asciidoc '*') for enumerations and elements that do not require a specific order. A numbered list example . First step . Second step . Third step First step Second step Third step Table 13. Bullet point list example 'ingredients' No Yes first 2 apples, then one banana. And you need an orange too! two apples one banana one orange Figures, like pictures or drawings, may be used to illustrate complex facts. Preferred format: .svg Figures are stored in a subfolder named images located inside the chapter folder. Each figure shall have: a tag a caption the link to the picture an alternative text [#fig-uuid] .This is the caption of the figure image::logo.png[an alternative text] Figure 1. This is the caption of the figure Use tables if you have to present a huge amount of similar data in a very compressed form. A table shall have: a tag a caption [#tab-uuid] .This is the caption of the table |=== |cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3 |cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3 |cell 3_1 | cell 3_2 | cell 3_3 |=== Table 14. This is the caption of the table cell 1_1 cell 1_2 cell 1_3 cell 2_1 cell 2_2 cell 2_3 cell 3_1 cell 3_2 cell 3_3 Sometimes you may need to display a character that is reserved for adoc-formatting. Here is how to do it. Underscore (_) Use _ to display an underscore. Pound sign (#) Use # to display a pound sign. Protected space ( ) Use {nbsp} to define a space character is not used for automatic line breaks. This is especially useful for value-unit-pairs like 5{nbsp}m/s (5 m/s) to ensure that value and unit are always in the same line of text. Consider one of the following possibilities if you want to add source code examples to an adoc topic. You may use small bits of code as an inline literal directly inside your text. You may add source code as a fragment from a source code file by reference. You may copy and paste source code directly as a snippet into the adoc topic. For very small bits of code using inline literals is the most convenient way to add source code examples. This type of including source code is especially useful if you want to highlight single code elements like methods or class names. Enclose the source code in a pair of pluses surrounded by a pair of backticks, like this: Call the `+source_example_func()+` for the result. The previous line looks like this as adoc output: Call the source_example_func() for the result. You can add source code as a fragment from a source code file if you would like to reference to the source code within the source code file. There are several advantages of using fragments: You do not need to copy the source code into the documentation. You are referencing to the single point of truth, which is the source code file. If you apply changes to the source code file, these changes are automatically applied to your documentation. Follow these steps to add source code fragments to your documentation: Add source comment tags at the beginning and the end of the part of code you want to use in your code block. Use this tag to include the fragment into the adoc documentation. The example in the following subchapters uses the tag exampleInclude to add a code fragment. Tags for the inclusion of source code from a source code file [...] // tag::exampleInclude[] (1) (2) function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor /examplecode.js[tags=exampleInclude] (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block You can reference this anchor using > 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Directly include the source code within the source code file with a tag marking fragment. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. For more information see the Asciidoctor reference. This is how the reference looks like inside the adoc file: ASAM example code block included by tags function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block. Reference this anchor using > 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Insert the code block. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. This is how the correctly configured snippet looks like in the adoc file: ASAM example code block included in an asciidoc file Use [source, osc2] as a source block identifier for fragments and snippets (see example) to define the language type as 'osc2'. This enables future automatic syntax highlighting. The project uses the adoc attribute draft to steer the review process. This FAQ helps you to manage the review and attribute handling. Q1 What is this draft-attribute for? New content on the trunk has to be marked with the ifdef::draft[] - endif::draft[] 'feature flag' mechanism. New content in this case means content in adoc files that is not already reviewed and agreed on, like newly merged text from a development branch. A typical adoc topic looks like this: [#top-an-example-topic] = Topic heading ifdef::draft[] Some content that is new or still needs to be reviewed and agreed on. endif::draft[] Some other content that is already reviewed and ready for being part of the standard documentation. When a review is started, a WG-Lead or a member of the CCB removes the draft-mechanism for the part that has to be reviewed in the review merge request. Q2 I cannot see my content in the preview. What is wrong?:: You may experience an empty preview in your editor when editing files that contain the mechanism. + This is actually a good sign. The preview is working correctly and hides all parts marked as draft. + To make the parts visible again, you have to set the attribute draft for your preview window. In the Asciidoc extension settings go to Preview:Attributes - Edit in settings.json. In the settings.json add the draft attribute: \"asciidoc.preview.attributes\": { \"draft\": \"\" } Save settings.json Go to Settings on the right hand side of the preview Go to the Preview settings tab Add an Asciidoctor Attribute by double-clicking an empty attribute line Add attribute draft with value true Save the settings (small button on the lower left of the tab!) Reload the preview Other tools should have similar settings. The preview in Gitlab intentionally shows the release version of the files, meaning that the parts marked as draft are hidden. You can easily switch off the preview and view the source content by clicking on the display source-icon on top of the file window: Figure 2. How to switch to source-view in Gitlab The icon next to it switches back to the preview. Q3 My preview looks fine. Why do I get feedback that something is not formatted correctly?:: Please note that all the previews described in this chapter are just for your convenience. The only reliable documents for reviews are the html-artifacts generated by the CI-pipeline! These artifacts are linked at the beginning of review merge requests. You can also download the artifacts directly from the pipeline result page. For a short introduction to Asciidoc, see the https://code.asam.net/simulation/resources/-/blob/master/asciidoc_tutorial/asciidoc_tutorial.adoc. The adoc-templates can be found here. For a guide on how to format code examples see the https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/blob/master/Documentation/etc/guides/coding_style_guide.adoc. Topics for entities of the domain model can be automatically created if the UML diagrams contain specially formatted comments.

Use each of these sparingly. You don’t want to create pages that are full of notes and tips. They become less meaningful if you do. Here’s what each of these looks like when the AsciiDoc content is turned into HTML: This is a note. It includes extra info that a reader might need to know. Here’s a tip. A tip provides useful information that can help a user do something or understand something. This is important information that the reader must be aware of so they don’t do something that they shouldn’t. A caution advises the reader to act carefully. Use this in rare circumstances. And this is a warning that informs of danger or harm. This one should be used very rarely, as well. If you’re authoring new content, you’ll want to review this section for some nitty-gritty details. If you’re explaining how to perform a task, you might include introductory information before you get to the steps. And you might need to say what to do after completing the steps. If you do, it’s best to organize that information using headers, which enables scanning. Use the following headings as needed: AsciiDoc Result .What you'll need _The information the user needs to complete the task._ .About this task _Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task._ .Steps _The individual steps to complete the task._ .What's next? _What the user should do next._ What you’ll need The information the user needs to complete the task. About this task Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task. Steps The individual steps to complete the task. What’s next? What the user should do next. Each of these should include a . right before the text, like so: .What you'll need .About this task .Steps .What's next? This syntax applies bold text in a larger font. This section shows how to include code blocks in an ASAM standard. In the standard case, a fragment direcly from a source code file is included, to not have duplicated code in the document. This is shown in chapter [Code as fragment from source code file]. In some cases, e.g. examples, it is also possible to direcly include code in the documentation. This is shown in chapter Code as snippet in document.

It is intended for meetings during the Development phase, but may be applied to meetings in other phases as well. Project meetings are set up by the ASAM office, even when they are not the meeting host. All other meetings within a project (such as Sub-group meetings) have to be set up by the respective host. Every meeting has a host. This is the person who calls the meeting. The host has the following responsibilities: Define the minute taker. They can take that role themselves if they wish. If not, the assignee has to agree to this task first. Provide the agenda for the meeting Set up the meeting and send out the invites (exception: project meetings are set up by the ASAM office in coordination with the host) Moderate the meeting Ensure to stay within the defined timetable If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants (assignees) Ensure that minutes are taken and send out the link to them afterwards Follow up with assignees on assigned tasks after the meeting The minute taker is designated by the meeting host. This may be the host themselves. However, the host may not just appoint role to a project member without their consent. The order of responsibility regarding the taking of minutes is as follows: Host (since they usually do not need to travel) Service Provider Project Lead Office Responsible The minute taker has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Create the meeting notes document ahead of time Add the provided agenda to the meeting notes During the meeting Document the participants as well as missing meeting members Take notes during the meeting Document all assigned tasks with their assignees Add provided links and documents After the meeting Request missing documents and links from the responsible participants Update the notes with delivered updates (e.g. links to files) Finalize the notes once everything has been provided Inform the host in case of overdue tasks The host of the meeting is responsible for providing a meeting agenda ahead of time. The agenda must be shared in the invite to the meeting. The agenda also has to be included in the meeting notes. Each agenda must at least have the following contents: Antitrust Reminder scheduled votes for the meeting documentation of participants voting template agenda items The target audience depends on your meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR. The OpenX Calendar The list of project participants can be found in the project’s participant list. This list also contains information on the group or groups each participant is part of. Feel free to use whatever solution you or your company normally use. If your company does not provide you with a suitable solution, send the details to your ASAM representative and they will assist (either with Teams or Zoom). Meetings are the default way of taking project- or Sub-group-level polls. Their results have to be made available in the corresponding meeting notes. By default, polls are announced in the agenda (before the meeting takes place). However, if spontaneous topics arise, ad hoc polls can be held if all impacted participants are present. In case one or more crucial members for a topic’s ad hoc poll are missing, the poll has to be postponed and scheduled for the next meeting instead. A poll is only valid if at least 50% of registered active (sub-)group members cast their vote and the Issue Responsible (if defined) is present. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. A passive participant (someone not involved in the development directly) is neither considered for this threshold nor may they participate in any polls. To be eligible for casting a vote, a member has to have been present during the corresponding topic discussion/presentation. The only exception to this is voting for topics of static nature, such as meeting frequencies. All votes must be cast digitally and through an online tool (so both onsite and remote users can vote). ASAM recommends the use of \"Microsoft Forms\" in case of online voting. You can ask your ASAM Office Responsible for support on creating such a vote ahead of time. Do a quick vote first (e.g. show of hands). If it is unanimous, you can skip the formal process of voting. Make sure to document the result in either case, however. In a project-level meeting, each company has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all participating companies. It is recommended that if a company has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a company casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally), their vote is counted as abstention. In a Sub-group meeting, each participant has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all Sub-group members. This is independent of company affiliation. Meeting notes (minutes) are to be taken in the project’s repository. The repository contains a template for meeting notes that shall be used. The designated minute taker is responsible for taking the notes. The notes must contain all important decisions (including cast votes). Additionally, the next scheduled meeting shall be listed here as well. Schedule regular meetings at least every 6-8 weeks Send a reminder to all assignees with open topics with enough time ahead of the next meeting Schedule remote meetings only for organizational issues Present results, particularly substantial changes in Sub-groups, to the whole project group regularly If you want to give a presentation in a project meeting, upload your presentation in the meeting’s \"presentations\" folder in your project’s Sharepoint ahead of time Hosting workshops.

If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here. Remind people about their man-day commitments, too. Keep the discussion focused on topic Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic But let the discussion go for a while Drive discussion towards results/decisions (not towards own/right results/decisions) Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution Do not let the discussion become repetitive In case discussions are very controversial Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has been said, carry out a vote. If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something \"might not work\" or​ \"could be too slow\"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known. If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g. propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone ​ carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​ propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort) Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority. Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority. In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down Ask a member or the Service Provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic. In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on.

The Workshop is created using the provided (4a) Ideation Workshop gameplan. 5 Whether the idea is a new standard or not, the Idea Giver has to raise enough interest to gather the required amount of participants for the Proposal phase, which is at least 3. He keeps the ASAM Office informed about the status, and the ASAM Office may support by bringing the Idea Giver in contact with potentially interested parties at ASAM. 6 Once the requirements for entering the next phase have been fulfilled, the project may enter the Proposal phase. The details of each step of a phase are explained on separate child pages under the page containing the full diagram.

Commit and push plantuml files to gitlab. Make sure to adhere to the Commit message conventions. The pipeline then runs the script and adoc fragments are created automatically. If you want to exclude a uml-file from being analyzed, insert /'adoc-fileignore'/ at the beginning of the uml-file. Example 6. Exculding files @startuml foo /'adoc-fileignore'/ class bar { ... } @enduml If you want to check the content of the created fragments, you can download them as a pipeline artifact. Depending on which Gitlab page you are using you can find the artifacts at different places. Use the download button on the pipeline continuous integration page. Figure 1. Download option on CI page Use the download option on the page of the merge request. Figure 2. Download option on MR page Once the fragments are available in the pipeline you can use the anchors to link to specific parts or you can include the fragments in your adoc documents. Use the following link syntax in your document to link to details in the fragment: > A link to the anchor 'the-uid-of-the-fragment-detail' is created. The uid of the fragment is [#top---] The uid of the table with basic information is [#tab----basics] The uid of the table with standard and property information is [#tab----info] The uid of the table with state information is [#tab----states] You can make the adoc-fragment part of your adoc-topic by including it using the following syntax: include::./path/to/fragments/fragment_name.adoc[] This way the whole fragment appears as if it was copied into your topic.

The following sections contain some suggestions for project-specific labels. If a project wants to use additional custom labels for extra filter options, each label must be documented in the project documentation and be accessible to each project member. All ASAM projects have their individual work packages clustered into groups or categories. These labels are defined individually for each project and should be used to categorize issues. An issue can have multiple Group and Work Package labels provided that it is relevant to more than one of these. ASAM suggest the following naming schema for group/category labels: Suggested Sub-group label schema 'isSub-group':'Sub-group' Rules Remove spaces (\"Domain Model\" instead of \"DomainModel\") Example An issue label for the group Domain Model (DomainModel) would be 'isSub-group:DomainModel' This part contains all labels specific to the Proposal phase.

For example, if user A deletes a section in their copy and user B adds a new paragraph to it instead, the merging tool does not know whether to keep the section and add the changes made by user B or to delete it like user A did. One way of avoiding merge conflicts is to keep the TTL (time to live) of branches short. ASAM recommends a TTL of ⇐ 2 weeks. If the branch lives longer than expected, merge the parent branch (the trunk or original feature branch) into your branch once in a while. Alternatively, you can also rebase your branch to the parent branch again. This way you can solve the conflicts in your branch. For more information on the differences between merging and rebasing, see Merging vs. Rebasing. Once you create a merge request, your remote repository will tell you if there are merge conflicts. It leads you through the conflicting parts and lets you choose if your new or the old content is to be merged. Another option is to merge locally. You can use Git or Visual Studio Code for this. These tools also provide options to view conflicting changes and help you resolve them. After you have removed the conflicts, you can create a new commit to your branch that includes the fixes to resolve the conflict in the Merge/Pull Request.

A project may also have project-specific labels in addition to the official ones, specified directly in the project group. The content of issues is discussed and resolved through comments and replies to previous comments. Content Comments Replies The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue. In the case of a feature or chapter description, it contains the current content of that chapter. It shall always be up-to-date and contain the latest discussed and approved version. In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic. In the latter case, the content shall only be updated to correct mistakes therein.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label requires:Clarification to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label isStatus:Duplicate and assign the SUBGROUP LEAD The SG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to requires:Clarification and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to requires:ConceptualWork to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch Review implementation progress of issue with SUBGROUP LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Sub-group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to requires:CCBReview If changes were marked as draft, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to isStatus:WontBeFixed and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button.

The outline of the idea is: Add a button to the header supplemental Point the href to your target url (email or page) Add the required parameters like title and body after a ? What parameters are available depends on your target. For example, for the GitLab Service Desk, you must add the issue template in text-form as body here. For the GitHub URL query, you can choose to either append a template file (markdown) or add the it directly as body. The href attribute value must be a valid url, i.e. be url encoded. You can use an encoder like this one to encode your body.

To build the content without opening it automatically, add -s after \"build.py\" To reopen the last build, add -f after \"build.py\" To get more information on possible options, type -h after \"build.py\" The example below shows the differences between a remote build setup and a local build setup. All changes are applied in the project’s site.yml. Remote build Local build Build using the GitHub repository, the branches \"main\" and \"pre-restructuring\", and all tagged versions starting with \"v\". Use the folder \"content\" in the repository for this content source. content: sources: - url: https://github.com/asam-ev/asam-project-guide-content.git # - url: ./asam-project-guide-content branches: main, pre-restructuring # branches: main tags: v* start_path: content Build using the local folder \"asam-project-guide-content\" and only the branch \"main\". Use the folder \"content\" in the repository for this content source. content: sources: # - url: https://github.com/asam-ev/asam-project-guide-content.git - url: ./asam-project-guide-content # branches: main, pre-restructuring branches: main # tags: v* start_path: content The most likely reason here is that you are trying to build two separate branches or tags that have identical component descriptors (typically, these are named \"antora.yml\"). The default component descriptor applies automatic versioning based on git values. However, some configuration may lead to two separate branches or tags getting the same version in Antora. In this case, update at least one of the impacted component descriptors so that its version is different from the other. To do so, you can either set a manual value or update the rules that are applied the refname. The script must be executed from the correct folder. Navigate to the folder where the script is located. Open a terminal window Execute 'python build.py' Unfortunately, there are some features that will not be available without python (i.e. the custom macros and summary features). If you cannot use python for whatever reason, you may use a python docker container and run everything from within there. If you had already set up the Antora image with the one-time step docker-compose build antora before and it stopped working, there is a chance that some technical changes have been made. To switch to the newest setup, run 'docker-compose down' to stop any currently running docker-compose, delete the image related to the project-guide antora setup (e.g. \"asam-project-guide_antora\") with the docker rmi command (see docker rmi --help for more information) You might need to force the deletion! prune the volume used by antora re-do the \"only required once\" steps Any program that blocks the site folder will stop Antora from generating the new pages. The reason is that it needs to delete the existing folder first before the new content is then written into it. Make sure that no program is currently accessing and blocking files or folders from the \"./site\" path.

In case a new project is proposed, the first step is to create an Executive Draft for internal analysis. Based on this draft, a rough Proposal Draft is then created that contains further details needed for the Proposal Workshop. This Proposal Draft is later further expanded and detailed until it is ready for submission to the TSC. The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be. A valid Project Proposal is created that can be brought to decision by the TSC. The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files, but the initial executive draft may be a Word document. For proposal submission, the proposal document must be converted into the appropriate Asciidoc structure. The idea has been proposed and approved in the Ideation Phase. The proposal needs at least three (3) partner companies. Access the project’s online repository through the link provided by your OR Optionally, check out the project repository or download the Executive Draft template and edit the AsciiDoc files directly. You must update the content of each chapter’s issue regardless of if you write in the AsciiDoc files directly or not!

Consequently, a project may only move from Proposal phase to Standard Development phase if at least one project member has declared their candidacy for Project Lead. In most projects, the Idea Giver candidates for Project Lead, but this is not a requirement. The Project Lead is the main responsible for a project. They coordinate general activities, track the progression, decide on changes and the project direction, and are the main contact point for ASAM for that project. Often, the original Idea Giver or the Proposal Submitter also become the Project Lead, but this is not mandatory. A Project Lead is responsible both for the project’s content and its coordination. However, a project can decide to pass the organizational tasks on to a contracted project support (typically: a Service Provider) so that the Project Lead can focus on the content specification of the project.

In these, Sub-group members define the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated). Goal The goal is to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. Repository suffix Standard All variants use the same repository suffix. The core of ASAM is to carry out standard development projects with the goal to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. ASAM defines three types of standard development projects, depending on the expected magnitude of changes to the standard: Major version [Minor version] Maintenance They all have in common that the primary output of the project is a standard. The upper limit for subsidiary funding from ASAM is 25% of the total required project budget. A major version development project is a new standard or a project that introduces significant changes to an existing standard, e.g. the addition of a new major feature or significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor. More details Table 1.

Summary Purpose Correct errors Remove ambiguities Add clarifications Make editorial improvements Change/add examples Version ?.?.X New Features n.a Backward compatible yes Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase Maintenance version developments of ASAM standards resolve technical issues with the currently released version of the standard. Maintenance version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Correction of errors. Removal of ambiguities. Addition of clarifications to existing descriptions. Editorial improvements. Any kind of changes to examples, including the addition of examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration ef-forts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. The only exception is, that a new feature has been forgotten in an earlier release of the standard and is absolutely required for a functional and meaningful standard. A new maintenance version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. The only exception is, that the correction of an error or the removal of an ambiguity cannot be reasonably solved in any other way than breaking the backward-compatibility. An exception requires approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Maintenance development projects may be converted to a minor or major version development project during the course of the project term, if backward-compatibility issues turn out to be too severe or new features need to be added. The TSC has to approve this change of project type. Only those ASAM members, who were actively involved in development of the preceding major or minor version, can participate in the maintenance development project. Maintenance projects are limited to a life cycle of up to 18 months. Unlike other project types, the paid Service Provider for a maintenance project can be contracted without a public request for quotation. The Service Provider is confirmed by the TSC and is appointed before the project starts. The Project Leader and the Service Provider must be employees from different companies. The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: \"?.?.X\". X is an integer number starting with 1. ? represents the current major and minor release number.

Study projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards among the participants, to promote their application in member companies and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards. This project type is specifically intended for members in regions, where ASAM standards are not well known. The content of study projects can be, but is not limited to: collaborative self-study of an ASAM standard receive training on an ASAM standard carry out a suitability analysis of an ASAM standard against defined use-cases carry out a pilot project to become familiar with the practical application of ASAM-related tools carry out an interoperability analysis of ASAM-related tools Study projects have no expected deliverables other than a final report. The members of study projects shall be pledged to submit change requests, if they find issues or gaps in ASAM standards. The standard development process does not apply for study projects in case that either no budget or a small budget is needed. The process to request, approve and carrying out a study project is: Member submits a study project information sheet to the ASAM Office for project approval. ASAM Office checks the information and approves or rejects the project. ASAM Office informs the TSC about the project. ASAM Office publishes an announcement of the project. The study project starts and is being carried out as described in the study project information sheet. The ASAM Office monitors the project activities. Some further rules apply for study projects: Participation in study projects is open for all ASAM members, e.g. also to members in a non \"active\"membership class. Participation in a study project can be restricted to members of a specific region, e.g. Japan only. The working language can be different than English. The project members elect a Project Leader. Meetings are documented via meeting minutes in English language. The minutes may be translated into the working language of the study group. The project members use the ASAM IT infrastructure. Upon request, ASAM provides funding for study projects up to the limit for small budget projects. In case that a larger budget is required beyond the limit of a small budget project, then the project must be requested via the regular project proposal process, which consist of the process steps P2 Proposal Writing, P3 Proposal Submission, P4 Proposal Publication and P5 Proposal Decision by the TSC.","title":"Study project","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"project-type-study","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/compendium/TBD/project-type-study.html","titles":[{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":1},{"text":"Project type description","hash":"_project_type_description","id":2}]},"162":{"id":162,"text":"To make a good faith effort to ensure licensing criteria are met, ASAM open source projects require the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process to be followed. The DCO is an attestation attached to every contribution made by every developer. In the commit message of the contribution, (described more fully later in this document), the developer simply adds a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO. When a developer submits a patch, it is a commitment that the contributor has the right to submit the patch per the standard license. The DCO agreement is shown below and online. Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 By making a contribution to this project, I certify that: (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as Indicated in the file; or (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it. (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved. The DCO requires a sign-off message in the following format appear on each commit in the pull request: Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname The DCO text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either -s or --signoff to your usual Git commit commands. If you forget to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit with the sign-off by running git commit --amend -s. You can add sign-offs to multiple commits (including commits originally authored by others, if you are authorized to do so) using git rebase --signoff. If you’ve pushed your changes to GitHub already you’ll need to force push your branch after this with git push --force-with-lease. If you want to be reminded to add the sign-off for commits in your repository, you can add the following commit-message git hook to your repository: #!/bin/sh # = Check for DCO/Signed-off-by in message # if ! grep -q \"^Signed-off-by: \" \"$1\" then echo \"Aborting commit: Commit message is not signed off\" >&2 exit 1 fi Placing this script into a file called .git/hooks/commit-msg and making it executable (e.g. using chmod a+x .git/hooks/commit-msg on unixoid operating systems) will prevent commits that do not have a sign-off.

TECHNICAL WRITER SERVICE PROVIDER Docker is a platform where you use so-called containers to run applications in an encapsulated environment. With this, you do not need to install and configure software, programming languages etc: just download and use a pre-configured container that has all the relevant configuration already built in. From the docker homepage: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Figure 1. The Docker architecture For Asciidoc, docker can be used to run a pre-configured asciidoctor setup for creating html output locally. This removes the need to upload adoc files and use the build pipeline for every change you want to see. It also means you do not have to install and configure Asciidoctor first since this is already done in the pre-configured Docker image. If you do not have Docker installed, check out the Docker before continuing. If your project is currently missing the docker-compose.yml, see these Standard Docker-Compose YAML on how to set it up. A project’s final specification document is created as HTML file. However, having to run it through the pipeline every time before being able to see the final result after having made changes is neither efficient nor friendly to the other Sub-group members. To render a project’s documentation without having to upload it, use Docker Compose with a correctly defined docker-compose.yml file.

A typical cycle lasts for two (2) months. During this period, each WG will schedule one or more Sub-group Meetings. Additionally, the Project Lead (and possibly the CCB) may meet with the SG Leads in one or more SG Lead Meetings. Finally, the CCB may schedule CCB Meetings. Note that each project decides on the frequency of each of these meetings for themselves during the project’s Kick-off Meeting. These intervals may be changed during the project if the group agrees to the suggested changes and the alterations are documented. A Development Cycle only consists of the project-internal activities, such as group meetings and content discussions. Topics that have an effect on the project or are affected by it are not included in the overall cycle structure. However, the project must still accommodate for these events. Two typical examples for these external events are TSC Controlling Meetings and CGSim Controlling Meetings, which have their own project-independent schedules and intervals. The Project Lead must make sure that the mandatory external meetings are accounted for in each Development Cycle. If an external meeting requires preparations by the project (e.g. a status report), the Project Lead must ensure that these preparations are made in time.

The Project Proposal is a written document that is submitted to the TSC for project approval before any project at ASAM may start. All committed participants (the Idea Giver, the Proposal Submitter, and all prospective Sub-group Members) can participate in writing the proposal document (the Proposal Submitter actually has to participate in the finalization step). See The Proposal document for more information on the document and its intended contents. You must first complete the Minimum Required Setup before you can participate in and contribute to any project. Participation in the creation of a Project Proposal follows the central Trunk-based Workflow at ASAM. If you want to learn more about this workflow, click the link. To contribute to a Project Proposal, project members can either contribute through GitLab issues or contribute directly in AsciiDoc. However, at least one person must transfer all content to the AsciiDoc file eventually. Both ways of contribution can be performed without software installation directly through the respective web interface. If you prefer to work on your local computer, see the list of recommended tools. The content of a Proposal document shall be drafted and discussed through issues in the project’s issue board. ASAM provides guidelines on how to contribute through issues on the page Proposal phase contribution guidelines. All participants must follow these guidelines. The project may decide to contribute directly in AsciiDoc as well. However, content shall still be discussed and updated in issues as described in Contributing through issues. When writing AsciiDoc, writers must follow the guidelines described in Contributing in AsciiDoc files as well as the ASAM Editorial Guide. The content that is defined in the project’s issues must be transferred to AsciiDoc eventually. ASAM recommends that the project defines one or more writers responsible for this task. When writing AsciiDoc, writers must follow the guidelines described in Contributing in AsciiDoc files as well as the ASAM Editorial Guide. ASAM provides an Editorial Guide containing the writing guidelines applicable to all ASAM documents. The current version of the Editorial Guide is located in the Project Guide Compendium. The Editorial Guide is mandatory for all Technical Writers and recommended for users contributing content through issues. Responsible Idea Giver Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, OFFICE RESPONSIBLE Step TL;DR Write the Motivation section Define use cases Refer to known existing standards Fill in all technical chapters Discuss and optimize together with ASAM Office The ASAM Office assists the writer(s) by giving advice with respect to ASAM guideline and best practices. In case a new project is proposed, the first step is to create an Executive Draft for internal analysis. Based on this draft, a rough Proposal Draft is then created that contains further details needed for the Proposal Workshop. This Proposal Draft is later further expanded and detailed until it is ready for submission to the TSC. The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be. A valid Project Proposal is created that can be brought to decision by the TSC. The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files, but the initial executive draft may be a Word document. For proposal submission, the proposal document must be converted into the appropriate Asciidoc structure. The idea has been proposed and approved in the Ideation Phase. The proposal needs at least three (3) partner companies. Access the project’s online repository through the link provided by your OR Optionally, check out the project repository or download the Executive Draft template and edit the AsciiDoc files directly. You must update the content of each chapter’s issue regardless of if you write in the AsciiDoc files directly or not! Fill in the default structure as follows (in the respective issues): Add a comprehensive 'Executive Summary' outlining the general idea of the proposed project Describe the reasons for this proposed project in the 'Motivation' section Define a set of (initial) use cases in the 'Use Cases' section (OPTIONAL) If you know of other standards this proposal relates to (ASAM or other), list them in the 'Relations to Other Standards or Organizations' section (OPTIONAL) Create an initial structure for the section 'Technical Content' and fill write as much project specific content as possible Discuss and optimize the document with your OR Transfer the issues' content to the project’s AsciiDoc files. The OR will support you with this task, if needed. Note that you do not need to render the document manually. The repository’s pipeline will create the required documents as artifacts automatically when the changes are committed and pushed to the trunk. See Access compiled artifacts to learn more about pipeline artifacts and how you can access them. The sections 'Project Resources' and 'Project Plan' will be filled out at a later stage and do not need to be edited in this draft. Responsible Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, OFFICE RESPONSIBLE Step TL;DR Create the milestone plan Finalize content for submission Review content with proposal team Once the Proposal Workshop has taken place, the Proposal must be finalized. To do so, the Proposal Submitter (and all other involved writers) shall consider the following input for finalizing the project proposal: the existing Proposal draft meeting minutes of the Proposal Workshop relevant papers from concept projects (if any) The Submitter shall estimate the work efforts of the project and create a milestone plan. The duration of the plan shall not exceed 1.5 years. The Office then checks the proposal document for formal compliance and understandability. The proposal may contain a request for video conferencing support through the Office, if project group members originate from locations that would require long-distance (i.e. inter-continental) business trips to regularly participate at project meetings. The Submitter shall send out the proposal to all participants of the Proposal Workshop (if this occurred) for review before submitting it.","title":"Writing a Project Proposal","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"proposal_writing","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/getting-involved/proposal/proposal_writing.html","titles":[{"text":"The proposal document","hash":"_the_proposal_document","id":1},{"text":"How to contribute","hash":"_how_to_contribute","id":2},{"text":"Contributing through issues","hash":"_contributing_through_issues","id":3},{"text":"Contributing directly in AsciiDoc","hash":"_contributing_directly_in_asciidoc","id":4},{"text":"Transferring content to AsciiDoc","hash":"_transferring_content_to_asciidoc","id":5},{"text":"ASAM Editorial Guide","hash":"_asam_editorial_guide","id":6},{"text":"Writing the Proposal draft","hash":"_writing_the_proposal_draft","id":7},{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":8},{"text":"Result","hash":"_result","id":9},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":10},{"text":"How","hash":"_how","id":11},{"text":"Finalizing the Proposal","hash":"_finalizing_the_proposal","id":12}]},"195":{"id":195,"text":"Responsible OFFICE RESPONSIBLE Involved Idea Giver, PROJECT PARTICIPANT Step TL;DR If completely new, create new Sub-group with the proposed project name in Simulation and add members If not new, update the assigned members Fork the proposal template repository into this proposal Sub-group as \" Proposal\" Inform members The basis for collaboration on Proposals at ASAM is GitLab.

Consequently, a project may only move from Proposal phase to Standard Development phase if at least one project member has declared their candidacy for Project Lead. In most projects, the Idea Giver candidates for Project Lead, but this is not a requirement. The Project Lead is the main responsible for a project. They coordinate general activities, track the progression, decide on changes and the project direction, and are the main contact point for ASAM for that project. Often, the original Idea Giver or the Proposal Submitter also become the Project Lead, but this is not mandatory. A Project Lead is responsible both for the project’s content and its coordination. However, a project can decide to pass the organizational tasks on to a contracted project support (typically: a Service Provider) so that the Project Lead can focus on the content specification of the project.

It uses a problem- or task-oriented notation, such as UML, BNF, or any suitable description for protocols. The specification is technology- and implementation-independent. Typically, this is a format description (data structure) or a protocol definition or an API and has the following properties: Platform-independent Technology-independent Supplier-independent Does not contradict any other ASAM standard Each ASAM standard contains exactly one specification document. This document is normative by default. It may contain non-normative content as long as it is clearly marked as such. Reference A reference document contains information related to implementers.

Guideline A guideline document contains information related to users. The name of each guideline document is prepended by its type or target audience. For example, a guideline for modeling scenarios would be named \"Modelling Guideline\". This information is non-normative. The following list contains common examples for other types of deliverables.

A typical example of a model file in ASAM standards are UML models created with the tool \"Enterprise Architect\" (.ea). Schema files Schema files define the formal structure and syntax of text files. They are used for automated schema validation. Typical examples of schema files are XML definition files (.xsd) or Google protocol buffers definition files (.proto).

PROJECT LEAD SUBGROUP LEAD OFFICE RESPONSIBLE CCB Member This page contains general guidelines on meetings in projects. It is intended for meetings during the Development phase, but may be applied to meetings in other phases as well. Project meetings are set up by the ASAM office, even when they are not the meeting host. All other meetings within a project (such as Sub-group meetings) have to be set up by the respective host. Every meeting has a host. This is the person who calls the meeting. The host has the following responsibilities: Define the minute taker. They can take that role themselves if they wish. If not, the assignee has to agree to this task first. Provide the agenda for the meeting Set up the meeting and send out the invites (exception: project meetings are set up by the ASAM office in coordination with the host) Moderate the meeting Ensure to stay within the defined timetable If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants (assignees) Ensure that minutes are taken and send out the link to them afterwards Follow up with assignees on assigned tasks after the meeting The minute taker is designated by the meeting host. This may be the host themselves. However, the host may not just appoint role to a project member without their consent. The order of responsibility regarding the taking of minutes is as follows: Host (since they usually do not need to travel) Service Provider Project Lead Office Responsible The minute taker has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Create the meeting notes document ahead of time Add the provided agenda to the meeting notes During the meeting Document the participants as well as missing meeting members Take notes during the meeting Document all assigned tasks with their assignees Add provided links and documents After the meeting Request missing documents and links from the responsible participants Update the notes with delivered updates (e.g. links to files) Finalize the notes once everything has been provided Inform the host in case of overdue tasks The host of the meeting is responsible for providing a meeting agenda ahead of time. The agenda must be shared in the invite to the meeting. The agenda also has to be included in the meeting notes. Each agenda must at least have the following contents: Antitrust Reminder scheduled votes for the meeting documentation of participants voting template agenda items The target audience depends on your meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR. The OpenX Calendar The list of project participants can be found in the project’s participant list. This list also contains information on the group or groups each participant is part of. Feel free to use whatever solution you or your company normally use. If your company does not provide you with a suitable solution, send the details to your ASAM representative and they will assist (either with Teams or Zoom). Meetings are the default way of taking project- or Sub-group-level polls. Their results have to be made available in the corresponding meeting notes. By default, polls are announced in the agenda (before the meeting takes place). However, if spontaneous topics arise, ad hoc polls can be held if all impacted participants are present. In case one or more crucial members for a topic’s ad hoc poll are missing, the poll has to be postponed and scheduled for the next meeting instead. A poll is only valid if at least 50% of registered active (sub-)group members cast their vote and the Issue Responsible (if defined) is present. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. A passive participant (someone not involved in the development directly) is neither considered for this threshold nor may they participate in any polls. To be eligible for casting a vote, a member has to have been present during the corresponding topic discussion/presentation. The only exception to this is voting for topics of static nature, such as meeting frequencies. All votes must be cast digitally and through an online tool (so both onsite and remote users can vote). ASAM recommends the use of \"Microsoft Forms\" in case of online voting. You can ask your ASAM Office Responsible for support on creating such a vote ahead of time. Do a quick vote first (e.g. show of hands). If it is unanimous, you can skip the formal process of voting. Make sure to document the result in either case, however. In a project-level meeting, each company has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all participating companies. It is recommended that if a company has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a company casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally), their vote is counted as abstention. In a Sub-group meeting, each participant has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all Sub-group members. This is independent of company affiliation. Meeting notes (minutes) are to be taken in the project’s repository. The repository contains a template for meeting notes that shall be used. The designated minute taker is responsible for taking the notes. The notes must contain all important decisions (including cast votes). Additionally, the next scheduled meeting shall be listed here as well. Schedule regular meetings at least every 6-8 weeks Send a reminder to all assignees with open topics with enough time ahead of the next meeting Schedule remote meetings only for organizational issues Present results, particularly substantial changes in Sub-groups, to the whole project group regularly If you want to give a presentation in a project meeting, upload your presentation in the meeting’s \"presentations\" folder in your project’s Sharepoint ahead of time Hosting workshops. Meeting moderation. Meeting logistics. PROJECT LEAD OFFICE RESPONSIBLE Moderator must be neutral Allow all opinions. Hold back own opinion and proposals. Drive consensus building​ independent of own position. Accept the majority.​ Do not be judgmental. Let the group be judgmental: Yes ​ No \"That is excellent!\" → \"What do the others think about it? \"That is nonsense!\"​ → \"Does anyone has objections about that proposal?\" \"Let’s do this!\"​ → \"Should we do this?\" Moderator can voice his opinion and make own proposals Moderator must still remain neutral when managing the meeting. Give other opinions and proposals the same attention than yours.​ Moderator should send a second employee, who can openly represent the company’s opinion and proposals. Moderator must treat him like everyone else.​ Moderator must have technical competence in the standard’s subject matter In case the number of people who come to meetings drop A small decline in participation is normal and shall be accepted. If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here. Remind people about their man-day commitments, too. Keep the discussion focused on topic Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic But let the discussion go for a while Drive discussion towards results/decisions (not towards own/right results/decisions) Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution Do not let the discussion become repetitive In case discussions are very controversial Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has been said, carry out a vote. If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something \"might not work\" or​ \"could be too slow\"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known. If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g. propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone ​ carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​ propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort) Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority. Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority. In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down Ask a member or the Service Provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic. In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on. Moderator takes the initiative and drives the discussion forward with his own proposals. This is typically a situation, where the moderator can give up neutrality a bit without doing damage to the meeting culture. Give a summary of what has been said. Propose a conclusion/decision Obtain consensus of the conclusion/decision Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo Carry out a vote if needed Document key-points of the discussion (in a projected memo TODO)","title":"OpenX Calendar - Best Practices","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"calendar-best-practices","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/compendium/Tools/calendar/calendar-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"General tips","hash":"_general_tips","id":1},{"text":"General meeting guidelines","hash":"_general_meeting_guidelines","id":2},{"text":"Roles in meetings","hash":"_roles_in_meetings","id":3},{"text":"Meeting host","hash":"_meeting_host","id":4},{"text":"Minute taker","hash":"_minute_taker","id":5},{"text":"Meeting agenda","hash":"_meeting_agenda","id":6},{"text":"Whom to invite","hash":"_whom_to_invite","id":7},{"text":"Setting up a meeting","hash":"_setting_up_a_meeting","id":8},{"text":"Polls and voting","hash":"_polls_and_voting","id":9},{"text":"Project-level voting","hash":"_project_level_voting","id":10},{"text":"Sub-group voting","hash":"_sub_group_voting","id":11},{"text":"Meeting notes","hash":"_meeting_notes","id":12},{"text":"Best practices","hash":"_best_practices","id":13},{"text":"Related topics","hash":"_related_topics","id":14},{"text":"Meeting moderation","hash":"_meeting_moderation","id":15},{"text":"Meeting moderation best practices","hash":"_meeting_moderation_best_practices","id":16},{"text":"Before a meeting","hash":"_before_a_meeting","id":17},{"text":"During a meeting","hash":"_during_a_meeting","id":18},{"text":"At the end of a meeting","hash":"_at_the_end_of_a_meeting","id":19}]},"207":{"id":207,"text":"SUBGROUP LEAD PROJECT LEAD All OpenX projects share a calendar under the email address of openx@asam.net.

Ask for a code review in the project’s chat room. A team member other than the author reviews the pull request. They follow Code Review guidelines to avoid miscommunication. They make comments and ask questions directly on lines of code in the GitHub web interface or in the project’s chat room. For changes which they can make themselves, they check out the branch. git checkout ./bin/setup git diff staging/main..HEAD They make small changes right in the branch, test the feature on their machine, run tests, commit, and push. Make sure to adhere to the Commit message conventions. When satisfied, they comment on the pull request Ready to merge. Rebase interactively.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label requires:Clarification to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label isStatus:Duplicate and assign the SUBGROUP LEAD The SG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to requires:Clarification and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to requires:ConceptualWork to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch Review implementation progress of issue with SUBGROUP LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Sub-group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to requires:CCBReview If changes were marked as draft, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to isStatus:WontBeFixed and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident. The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'. Click here for more information. If the review feedback requires further development work, the process restarts from the Implementation stage Tips Technical discussion happen in comments Change Control Board review Who CCB Steps If there are no unresolved comments or threads after two weeks, the CCB ends the review The Merge/Pull Request is assigned to the Service Provider for Integration Who SERVICE PROVIDER Steps The Service Provider changes the status label to requires:DocumentationWork The Service Provider refines the content in the Merge/Pull Request The content is adjusted to adhere to ASAM style and writing conventions General editorial rewrites to ensure homogeneity of content Questions on content should be addressed to the original issue assignee who will be responsible for ensuring a satisfactory resolution. In the case that questions lead to significant changes to the content, the MR is reopened for review on resolution. On completion of the integration: Set the status label of the Merge/Pull Request to requires:CCBReview Set to squash commits with fast-forward merging (default). Who CCB Steps CCB performs a final review of the integrated content Is the original content still correctly represented? Are all guidelines & conventions maintained? Are all discussions resolved? Does it have a clear commit history? If the review is not passed, return to Integration If the review is passed and the CCB can merge, the CCB merges the Merge/Pull Request back to the trunk The CCB removes the status label and closes the linked issue If the review is passed but the CCB may not merge, the CCB changes the status label to requires:Merge Tips Use a pull request for code reviews. Delete local and remote feature branches after merging. You can contribute to ASAM projects directly through issues. These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project. It must be possible for every project member to contribute to and give feedback on the content of a Proposal document directly. For this purpose, all content discussions shall happen through issues in a project’s issue board. A clean issue contains the following things: active milestone assignee labels If your project is on ASAM GitLab, see the GitLab instructions for creating issues. If your project is on GitHub, see the GitHub instructions for creating issues. Every topic shall have its own issue. If a topic is too complex for a single issue, sub-issues shall be created. An issue with sub-issues shall only be closed if all its sub-issues have been closed. If an issue has a branch, the issue shall not be closed before the branch has been merged or closed. Issues shall be created using the provided issue templates in the repository. Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where. Figure 2. Creating an issue from a template The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently. Each issue and merge/pull request must apply labels as defined in labels.adoc. A project may also have project-specific labels in addition to the official ones, specified directly in the project group. The content of issues is discussed and resolved through comments and replies to previous comments. Content Comments Replies The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue. In the case of a feature or chapter description, it contains the current content of that chapter. It shall always be up-to-date and contain the latest discussed and approved version. In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic. In the latter case, the content shall only be updated to correct mistakes therein. A comment to an issue is a new topic that is independent from any previous comment. GitLab GitLab instructions for commenting GitHub GitHub instructions for commenting Before you add a new comment to an issue, make sure it is not a duplicate (i.e. the same or a similar comment already exists) and that it is not supposed to be a reply! Failure to do so will prevent efficient project progress. A reply is a comment created as a reply to a previous comment. In the issue, it is a child comment to the previous one and listed in relation to it. GitLab GitLab instructions for threads/replies GitHub GitHub instructions for communication If you want to reply to a previous comment, make sure to create a reply, not a new comment! An issues shall be closed once its discussion is resolved. Possible reasons: The questions of the issue have been answered The bug has been fixed and the fixes have been reviewed and merged The feature has been developed, reviewed, and merged It is best practice to close an issue immediately after one of the closing conditions has been met. Additionally, an issue may also be closed without resolution if it has become obsolete it is a duplicate (i.e. another issue deals with the same topic already) Closed issues can be reopened if they have become relevant again, there have been new developments directly impacting this specific issue, or the issue has been closed by accident and has not actually been finished yet.","title":"Guides for remote repositories","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.0.0","name":"remote_repo_guides","url":"/projectintroduction/1.0.0/compendium/Tools/remote_repo/remote_repo_guides.html","titles":[{"text":"Remote repositories","hash":"_remote_repositories","id":1},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":2},{"text":"The trunk","hash":"_the_trunk","id":3},{"text":"Workflow overview","hash":"_workflow_overview","id":4},{"text":"Contributing through issues","hash":"_contributing_through_issues","id":5},{"text":"Make discussions accessible","hash":"_make_discussions_accessible","id":6},{"text":"Gather topics in issues","hash":"_gather_topics_in_issues","id":7},{"text":"Sub-issues","hash":"_sub_issues","id":8},{"text":"Closing issues and sub-issues","hash":"_closing_issues_and_sub_issues","id":9},{"text":"Use issue templates","hash":"_use_issue_templates","id":10},{"text":"Label issues correctly","hash":"_label_issues_correctly","id":11},{"text":"Discuss issue","hash":"_discuss_issue","id":12},{"text":"Close issues","hash":"_close_issues","id":13},{"text":"Reopening issues","hash":"_reopening_issues","id":14}]},"217":{"id":217,"text":"Remote Repositories provide an integrated working environment and text editor.

As an example, we will use the AsciiDoc extension. The AsciiDoc extension for VSCode allows for easy creation and supported editing of AsciiDoc or adoc files within VSCode. For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension. You can access this documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace. Access the extensions window through the VSCode menu bar → View → Extensions. Search for AsciiDoc (or use asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) & install it. The AsciiDoc extension will add the syntax the AsciiDoc interpreter to VSCode so you can use the preview feature and have syntax highlighting. Figure 1. AsciiDoc (id: asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) VSCode has a lot of very helpful extensions that can be downloaded and installed through the integrated marketplace. You can view the recommended list of extensions here. VSCode is already without extensions very powerful and user friendly. One thing that can make the VSCode experience even better are the extensions. There is a list of extensions we recommend that will make your life contributing to the ASAM standards way easier.

There are two types of standards: base standards and associated standards. Standards can consist of several parts. These parts are independent (e.g. technology references) and must each individually comply with the basic document structure for ASAM standards. A base standard defines the syntax, abstract models, and functionality for general use. A base standard is defined in a technology-independent form. It can use a problem-/task-related notation, e.g., UML for an object model, or any suitable description for protocols. Typically, a base standard is A Format description (data structure) or A Protocol definition or An API and has the following properties: Platform-independent Technology-independent Supplier-independent Does not contradict any other ASAM standard There are platform- and technology-specific mapping rules for each base standard. These are defined in a Technology Reference as independent parts of the base standard. A Format Description standard defines the syntax and semantics of a file format to exchange data. Currently, these standards are defined in XML, but older standards, such as ASAM MCD-2 MC (ASAP2), still use proprietary ASCII formats. There are also binary description standards, for example, to store measurement data efficiently. A Protocol Definition defines the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication. A communications protocol is a system of digital message formats and rules for exchanging the messages in or between computer systems. A protocol may have a formal description. A Technology Reference specifies the technology-dependent interpretation of the generic standard as mapping rules. If these mapping rules are complied with, the deliverables are technology-specific implementations of standards that are suitable for a specific implementation platform and native programming languages. These Technology References are typically available for base standards and companion standards. An associated standard always refers to a base standard. These are examples of associated standards: Application Area Companion Transport Layer Specification An Application Area Companion is an associated extension of a base standard for a specific type of device or a specific application area. A companion uses the syntax and the abstract models of the base standard. Companion standards describe models for application fields (application-specific information) and are technology-independent. A transport layer specification details, for example, how a generic protocol definition is to be interpreted using a concrete physical layer. The transport layer provides uniform access to the application-oriented layers, so that the application-oriented layers do not have to take the properties of the communication network into account. A \"set of standards\" is a special form comprising different elements in one standard. ASAM provides a template for creating an ASAM specification, including a description of use and illustrated by examples. The style sheet defines an identical look & feel for all ASAM standards. The main definitions are for the headers and footers, and for the cover page and directories. Rules for designing graphics, tables, source text, headings, etc. are included.","title":"Creation of standards","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"creation-of-standards","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/concepts/creation-of-standards.html","titles":[{"text":"Classification of standards","hash":"_classification_of_standards","id":1},{"text":"Base standard","hash":"_base_standard","id":2},{"text":"Format description","hash":"_format_description","id":3},{"text":"Protocol definition","hash":"_protocol_definition","id":4},{"text":"Technology reference","hash":"_technology_reference","id":5},{"text":"Associated standard","hash":"_associated_standard","id":6},{"text":"Application Area Companion","hash":"_application_area_companion","id":7},{"text":"Transport Layer Specification","hash":"_transport_layer_specification","id":8},{"text":"Set of standards","hash":"_set_of_standards","id":9},{"text":"Structure of standards","hash":"_structure_of_standards","id":10}]},"229":{"id":229,"text":"Many newer projects at ASAM follow the concept of Documentation as Code (Doc-as-Code). This concept refers to using the same tools and methods for documentation (or standardization) as for writing (software) code. The main benefit of this concept is the separation of content and text in documents from its layout rules and publishing. As described in the introduction, the general concept is to use established tools and processes from software development and apply them in the creation of documents. At ASAM, the main aspects of this concept are: Writing documents in plain text markup Using repositories with version control systems Collaborating on projects through online repository platforms At ASAM, the central aspect of this concept is the usage of plain text documents with a semantic markup language in creating standards and other documents, particularly the free AsciiDoc format. Its main benefit is the separation of content from style and layout rules, making it possible to specify general layout settings in a separate set of files and instructions for consistency over multiple projects. Writers also get the benefit of being able to focus on content first, handing of the layouting to other people. Another benefit is that AsciiDoc files can be opened and edited with any type of text editor, making it a platform-agnostic format. Different people can write content independent of the operating system on their work devices or requiring specific software licenses. Finally, the content is decoupled from the target output, making it easy to generate different types of documentation from the same source files, such as single-file PDFs as well as multi-page online documentation in html. It is even possible to generate multiple types of output in the same process. AsciiDoc source file Rendered output Figure 1. ASAM Foreword section in AsciiDoc (source) Figure 2. The same Foreword section rendered by Asciidoctor and Antora in HTML (rich output) If you want to learn more about AsciiDoc and how to use its powers in writing technical documents, see the official AsciiDoc Language Documentation and the Asciidoctor Writers Guide. Specific ASAM writing styles and rules can be found in the Editorial Guide. Besides the separation of source text and publication files, using tool-supported document versioning is another main aspect in the Doc-as-Code. ASAM projects employing Doc-as-Code use the software Git for this purpose. It allows for working on different parts, features, or versions of a project separately whilst also providing the necessary features for merging all changes that were made on these different versions again later. As this works best with plain text documents, it goes extremely well together with the plain text markup approach to document writing explained above. Content is stored in so-called repositories that each consist of one or more branches. At ASAM, there usually is one main branch (called \"main\" or (outdated) \"master\") and possibly one or more feature branches. The central branch (also called the \"trunk\") acts as the agreed or released \"official\" state of the repository, whereas the feature branches contain the current development topics. Each feature branch targets a single aspect of development, for example the language specification. Once the development in a feature branch has advanced enough, it’s changes are merged back into the trunk. This is done through a so-called Merge Request (MR), sometimes called a Pull Request (PR) instead. Figure 3. Repository workflow and branching example. The strategy of having one main branch (trunk) and develop changes in separate branches is called trunk-based development and the quasi-standard of modern software development. These repositories also contain some files with information about the history and current state of the content. The repository information is updated and used by Git and usually needs not to be changed by users manually. If you want to learn more about Git itself, ASAM recommends online introductions and tutorials such as this one. Additionally, you can find more information on using Git and working with repositories at ASAM in the tooling section. Contributing at ASAM is easy: you only need a web browser! The work on standards, particularly at ASAM, is of collaborative nature: People from different companies companies join in a project to develope something together. The idea is to create something that will be adapted and used not just by a single company but a majority of the target industry. Online repository platforms like GitLab and GitHub support the collaboration by providing features for commenting and reviewing content changes as well as issue boards for creating and tracking topics. In addition to that, they also integrate the same versioning and repository aspects described in the section above. Using online collaboration platforms with repository support provide multiple benefits: They typically provide online editors for content, so users can choose to participate in projects without having to install software (besides any standard web browser) Merge Requests (Pull Requests) can be reviewed and commented on with a side-by-side preview in the browser (diff view) They act as central repository location for the project(s) that can be accessed from anywhere (provided the user has sufficient rights), so all involved people always have access to the latest submitted changes They enable central automation steps through CI/CD pipelines, for example automated writing rules checks on a document after it was updated Integrated issue boards for keeping track of tasks, found problems, discussion topics, etc. The figure below shows an example issue from a project where a topic discussion takes place. Figure 4. Example for a topic discussion through the GitLab issue board in a project ASAM currently supports projects on both its internal GitLab instance as well as on the public GitHub. Each project can decide independently which platform it will use. GitLab is the most commonly used platform right now at ASAM.

Each project type is defined in the respective Proposal phase (see below) and specifies the expected outcome and requirements as well as restrictions for the project. Project phases A typical project goes through multiple phases at ASAM. Each phase has specific steps and events that must or can happen. Both the phases and the types are illustrated in a fictitious project’s lifecycle. Roles There are different roles for people working at or with ASAM. A person can have one or more roles, and most roles only apply within a given project.

Not all projects must necessarily pass through all these phases. See the phase descriptions below for more details. If you want to learn how to participate in a certain phase, check out the ASAM’s project processes part for more information. Figure 1. The ASAM Project Phases Ideation Proposal Development Review Release Public Retirement Purpose To decide whether an idea for a project is promising. Required for Any project not directly based on a previous project. If someone has an idea for a new standard, it triggers the ideation phase for a new project. During this phase, the idea is evaluated and fleshed out a bit until it is either discarded (e.g. it is not feasible or a duplicate of sorts) or accepted. In case the idea is accepted, the project moves on to the Proposal phase. Additional information Ideation phase Purpose To define funding and participants for a project and decide whether to proceed. Required for Every project type. Whether a project idea was just accepted or an improvement or update on an existing standard was proposed, the project enters the Proposal Phase. During this phase, a Proposal document is generated, detailing the project’s targets, participants, the budget, timeline, and other project-related information. The Project Type is also specified during this phase. With this document, the ASAM TSC decides if the project may continue or not. If the go-ahead is given, the project continues on to the [Development phase]. Additional information Proposal phase Purpose To develop the project’s deliverables. Required for Every project type. This is the main phase of each project. During this phase, the project-type specific deliverables are developed by the project participants. In the beginning, the project team organizes a workshop to specify their modus operandi and set up all technical aspects of the project. This is followed by specifying, writing, and reviewing content internally until the document or documents are ready for a ASAM-internal or public review in the [Review phase]. Additional information Development phase Purpose To review the developed deliverables. Required for New Standard Major Version Update Before they are officially released, the created deliverables are to be reviewed. Depending on the project, these reviews may be available to ASAM members only, free for the public, or a mixture of both. Any problems that are identified during any of these reviews are then analyzed and categorized. Important fixes have to be made before the deliverables are released, whilst improvements beyond the initial scope or minute details may be put off for future iterations. Additional information Review phase Purpose To release the developed deliverables. Required for Every project type. After the deliverables have been developed and (optionally) successfully reviewed by the TSC, they are released to the public. The project has now concluded. Developed and updated standards, however, will receive and process feedback afterwards in the [Public phase]. Additional information Release phase Purpose To apply the standard in the industry and officially support it. Required for Standards. During this phase, the released standard is publicly available and officially supported. There is no active development on the standard itself. However, feedback from users may still be gathered in order to start a follow-up project down the line to improve the standard. In this case, a new Project Proposal would be created and the process started anew. If, however, the standard at some point becomes obsolete or deprecated, it enters its final phase: the [Retirement phase]. Purpose To retire an outdated or deprecated standard. Required for Standards. This phase is the final phase for every standard eventually. The standard has become obsolete and is retired. With this, it will no longer be supported and propagated by ASAM.","title":"Project phases","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"project_phases","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/concepts/project_phases.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1}]},"234":{"id":234,"text":"This section needs approval by TSC. ASAM developes its products and results in projects. Different result types require different approaches and conditions. For this reason, ASAM defines three project types, which further characterize the work to be done within the projects. They are: Concept Standard development Study Figure 1. ASAM project types overview A new project can be triggered by either a new idea, a previous Concept Paper, or a previously released Standard. The intended output of each project type is a document. For a Concept project, the output is a Concept Paper (which can be the basis for a follow-up project) For a Standard Development project, the output is the standard + optional supplemental documents For a Study project, the output is a Study Report that details the findings of the project. Note that a new concept project is usually not triggered by a previous one. Table 1. Summary Purpose Develop supplementary products supporting the application of ASAM standards Funding Limit 75% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase Description Concept projects have the purpose to prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards. They are typically chosen when the envisioned standard is complex and requires significant resources to even develop a sound and solid project proposal. Goal The goals of concept projects are to propose specific content for ASAM standards and/or to provide justification for the usefulness, practicability, and feasibility of the proposed content.

Version 1.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A new standard is developed from the outset. There is no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio, or the predecessor has been declared as 'deprecated'. A new ASAM standard can be a transfer from another organization or an extension of a standard from another standardization organization. Table 3. Summary Purpose Add major features Make significant changes to existing features Version X.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A major version development project introduces significant changes to the standard, e.g. the addition of a new major feature or significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor. Table 4.

It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Table 5.

It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. A new revision version of an ASAM standard is always backward-compatible. Description Standard development projects are the core of ASAM. In these, workgroup members define the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated).

Each of these roles has their own set of requirements, mandatory and/or optional tool, guidelines and how-tos, some of them shared between multiple roles. Figure 1. Overview over the most relevant roles in ASAM projects. It is possible to have more than one role at the same time. Some roles require you to \"enroll in a project\" first. You can learn more about this process on the page Signing up for projects. The following table contains a list of the most prominent roles at ASAM and a short description for each of them. Click on a role’s label to navigate directly to the role’s summary page. Table 1. List of roles Outside roles (1) Someone who has access to and possibly is an active user of any ASAM standard. Some standards require ASAM membership in order to access the documents, whilst other standards are available to anyone online. The role Standard User is not directly involved in the creation of a standard. However, a Standard User may take over other (active) roles in a project by enrolling in it. Note that project participation also requires ASAM membership! (2) An ASAM member outside the project that participates in the review of one or more documents. When a project’s deliverables are reviewed, ASAM members who were not involved in the project directly can participate in the Review phase by becoming a Reviewer and providing feedback. Project roles (3) An ASAM member active in an ASAM project. Each project consists of multiple Project Participants who directly contribute to the project’s development. Most participants typically enroll during the Proposal phase, but it also possible to already participate during the Ideation phase. Typically, Project Participants work in one or more so-called Working Groups, each focussing on a specific aspect of the project. (4) The Project Participant responsible for the project and leading the general project activities. Every project needs one elected Project Lead who takes responsibility for it. The Project Lead is elected at the beginning of the Development phase. Any Project Participant can send in their candidacy during the Proposal phase. (5) A Project Participant leading the activities of a Working Group. Many projects divide up their activities into so-called Working Groups which focus on specific aspects of a project. Each of these groups may be led by a Working Group Lead. Supporting roles (6) ASAM contact of the project. A GTM is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project. (7) Editor and writing support. A Technical Writer supports the creation of documents. They ensure ASAM’s Editorial Guide is applied and the document is formalized. (8) Committee at ASAM reviewing a project’s state. The TSC is responsible for approving or rejecting budgets, projects and proposals as well as releases of project results, such as standards or concept papers.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users cannot commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in development or feature branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another feature branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Users MAY branch off the trunk for more focused development work. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label {requires:Clarification} to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label {isStatus:Duplicate} and assign the {role-wg-lead} The WG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to {requires:Clarification} and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue, applying the Branch Naming Conventions Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to {requires:ConceptualWork} to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch, adhering to the Commit Message Conventions Review implementation progress of issue with {role-wg-lead} and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Work Group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to {requires:CCBReview} If changes were developed in draft sections, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to {isStatus:WontBeFixed} and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Both tips reduce the chance for Merge Conflicts. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident. Mark passages which are not ready for viewing in the final output as draft (see Mark passages as draft) The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'. Click here for more information. If the review feedback requires further development work, the process restarts from the [Implementation] stage Tips Technical discussion happen in comments Change Control Board review Who CCB Steps If there are no unresolved comments or threads after two weeks, the CCB ends the review The Merge/Pull Request is assigned to the Service Provider for [Integration] Who SERVICE PROVIDER Steps The Service Provider changes the status label to {requires:DocumentationWork} The Service Provider refines the content in the Merge/Pull Request The content is adjusted to adhere to ASAM style and writing conventions General editorial rewrites to ensure homogeneity of content Questions on content should be addressed to the original issue assignee who will be responsible for ensuring a satisfactory resolution. In the case that questions lead to significant changes to the content, the MR is reopened for review on resolution. On completion of the integration: Set the status label of the Merge/Pull Request to {requires:CCBReview} Set to squash commits with fast-forward merging (default). Squash commit message MUST adhere to the Commit Message Conventions Who CCB Steps CCB performs a final review of the integrated content Is the original content still correctly represented? Are all guidelines & conventions maintained? Are all discussions resolved? Does it have a clear commit history that adheres to the Commit message conventions? If the review is not passed, return to [Integration] If the review is passed and the CCB can merge, the CCB merges the Merge/Pull Request back to the trunk The CCB removes the status label and closes the linked issue If the review is passed but the CCB may not merge, the CCB changes the status label to {requires:Merge} Tips Use a pull request for code reviews.

These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project. For more information, see Contributing through issues in the Compendium.

This document is submitted to the ASAM Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for approval. On approval, the next project phase (the Development Phase) can begin. Figure 1. The Proposal phase timeline In this phase, the proposed idea is further analyzed. In the Proposal document, central requirements are formulated, the expected effort is quantified, and the timeline is specified. In addition to that interested parties can sign up during this phase for project participation, the proposal is released to attract more attention as well as for transparency.

Responsible PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT, {role-wg-lead} The project group prepares a release candidate and agrees per formal voting to submit the candidate to the TSC for release decision. Each company has one vote. The release candidate is accepted by absolute two-thirds majority. The group’s decision is documented in the meeting minutes. The Project Leader submits the following deliverables to ASAM: the standard with all supplemental documents, files and examples that constitute the deliverables to members. sources required to generate the deliverables, including written instructions how to generate them. revision history documentation (not needed for version 1.0.0). new release presentation. Sources are those digital work products, which can be modified or edited with standard tools such as text editors, image processors or modeling tools, and which are the input for generators that produce the final deliverables. Purpose To review the deliverables, to clarify open questions, and to come to an individual conclusion about the release-worthiness of the release candidate. Responsible TSC MEMBER Involved {role-gtm} The TSC members review the release with special focus on the changes. They shall clarify open question with the Project Leader prior to the TSC meeting. TSC members shall make up their mind whether the release candidate is ready for publication. The minimum review period for release candidates is four weeks. Purpose To approve or reject the release candidate. Responsible TSC MEMBER Involved PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT, {role-wg-lead} Decisions on release candidates are put on the agenda of the next available TSC meeting. Release candidate decisions are handled during the meeting via a three-step process: Project leader presents the release candidate to the TSC members. TSC members are given the opportunity to ask questions. TSC members discuss the proposal (without Project Leader’s presence) and then proceed with casting their votes on the release. The TSC does not modify the content of the release candidate. If this is deemed to be necessary, then the release shall be rejected. The voting is carried out in accordance with the TSC voting rules. The Board Representative for the TSC has to confirm the TSC decision. The TSC may add requirements for rework of the release candidate and make the release contingent upon the completion of the required rework. The Office shall check the reworked release candidate submission. If the required rework has been implemented as defined by the TSC, then the release is effective and the release process continues. Purpose To prepare all marketing and distribution activities for the new standard release. Responsible {role-gtm} Involved PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT, {role-wg-lead} The Office prepares new and updates existing marketing and training material for the new release. The Project Leader shall support this activity by contributing technical content and reviewing the new or updated marketing and training material, upon request. The publication of a new standard shall occur within 5 weeks after the effective release. The publication of a new version of an existing standard shall occur within 3 weeks after the effective release decision. Purpose To go live with the released standard. Responsible {role-gtm} The Office carries out all planed publication activities. As a minimum, the Office undertakes the following publication measures: The standard can be sold or published freely and is downloadable from the ASAM website. The release is announced via newsletter.

The goal is to increase the overall quality and acceptance of the standard prior to its release. Figure 1. The Review phase Purpose To create a preliminary version of the standard for carrying out a public review. Responsible Project group Involved none The draft standard shall be feature-complete, i.e. the specification or revision of all features of the standard has been finished. The project group members determine, whether the standard is ready for public review. The Project Leader is responsible for delivering the draft document(s) in a format, which is usable in the ASAM IT-infrastructure for document reviews. Changes to the prior version shall be marked in the draft documents or documented in a separate change log with clear references to the draft documents. Public reviews are mandatory for new standards and major versions of existing standards. The project group releases a draft of the standard, which is feature-complete and has undergone an internal review. Purpose To obtain technical review feedback from members. Responsible Office Involved Members, project group The Office publishes the start of the public review process via newsletter and ASAM website, and provides additional information, such as a brief description of the changes in the standard, review process steps and the review deadline. The Office provides an IT-solution for carrying out the public draft review. The Office provides technical support for reviewers and ensures that review feedback is accessible to the project group members in a timely manner. In general, every ASAM member can download the draft standard and participate in the review. The Office may restrict the group of reviewers in agreement with the project group members or as per TSC decision. Members of the project group are available to answer technical questions from reviewers. Reviewers shall not submit new use-cases, features or requirements as part of their review feedback. The Office asks the reviewers to submit such requests via the regular ASAM CR system. The minimum review period for a new standard is 8 weeks and shall not exceed 16 weeks. The minimum review period for a major version is 6 weeks and shall not exceed 12 weeks. The ASAM office publishes the draft and provides an IT environment in which members can provide their comments. Members are given a minimum period of six weeks for the review (eight weeks for a new standard). Purpose To end the public review and have all feedback ready for the next process step. Responsible Office Involved none The Office terminates the public draft review process by: removing the draft standard download from the ASAM website. closing the IT-solution to accept further review feedback. Once the review period is over, the ASAM office removes the draft standard from public access and makes the review comments available to the project group. Purpose To review and decide upon the reviewers' feedback and to incorporate corresponding changes to the draft standard. Responsible Project group Involved Members The project group has the obligation to review each review feedback and make a decision on how to further work on it. The decision includes as a minimum the status \"accepted\", \"rejected\" or \"deferred\". The decision must be documented. Accepted feedback shall be implemented. The project group has full authority how to implement the reviewers' feedback into the standard. They can implement changes as proposed by the reviewer, or decide for a different implementation. If a reviewer’s feedback is actually out-of-scope, since it contains a request to consider a new use-case, feature or requirement, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the ASAM CR-system with status \"new\". ASAM has the obligation to inform reviewers about the status of their review feedback, upon their request. The project group members have the obligation to review each comment and make a decision. The project group has full authority to decide, how to handle a comment, e.g. to accept, modify, defer or reject comments, and to make corresponding changes to the standard at their own discretion.

List of roles Outside roles (1) Someone who has access to and possibly is an active user of any ASAM standard. Some standards require ASAM membership in order to access the documents, whilst other standards are available to anyone online. The role Standard User is not directly involved in the creation of a standard. However, a Standard User may take over other (active) roles in a project by enrolling in it. Note that project participation also requires ASAM membership! (2) An ASAM member outside the project that participates in the review of one or more documents. When a project’s deliverables are reviewed, ASAM members who were not involved in the project directly can participate in the Review phase by becoming a Reviewer and providing feedback. Project roles (3) An ASAM member active in an ASAM project. Each project consists of multiple Project Participants who directly contribute to the project’s development. Most participants typically enroll during the Proposal phase, but it also possible to already participate during the Ideation phase. Typically, Project Participants work in one or more so-called Working Groups, each focussing on a specific aspect of the project. (4) The Project Participant responsible for the project and leading the general project activities. Every project needs one elected Project Lead who takes responsibility for it. The Project Lead is elected at the beginning of the Development phase. Any Project Participant can send in their candidacy during the Proposal phase. (5) A Project Participant leading the activities of a Working Group. Many projects divide up their activities into so-called Working Groups which focus on specific aspects of a project. Each of these groups may be led by a Working Group Lead. Supporting roles (6) ASAM contact of the project. A GTM is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project. (7) Editor and writing support. A Technical Writer supports the creation of documents. They ensure ASAM’s Editorial Guide is applied and the document is formalized. (8) Committee at ASAM reviewing a project’s state. The TSC is responsible for approving or rejecting budgets, projects and proposals as well as releases of project results, such as standards or concept papers.","title":"ASAM roles","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"main","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/role-specific/main.html","titles":[]},"249":{"id":249,"text":"The person responsible for leading and coordinating all project activities.

It provides you a set of hints and rules that make it easier to contribute concise and homogeneous content and documents to the projects. If you are using VSCode, see the Recommended Visual Studio Code settings. NOTE: ASAM uses .adoc as fileextension for all AsciiDoc files. Use \"English (US)\" (ISO: en-US) as a language setting in your text editor. Mnemonic: -or, -l, -yze, -er Table 1. American English No Yes colour color labelling labeling analyse analyze centre center Use these modal verbs to express the level of obligation: Table 2. Proper modal verbs Level of obligation Verb to use Colloquial meaning Requirement shall, shall not mandatory statement, \"it must do/have\", \"it is not allowed to do/have\" Recommendation should, should not \"it is good/bad practice to do/have\" Permission may, need not \"it is allowed to do/have and also allowed not to do/have\" Possibility can, cannot \"it depends on some circumstances if or if not\" The differences between these verbs are subtle and sometimes difficult to grasp. The table with modal verbs is based on ISO guidelines but currently under discussion. It is possible that the table will be simplified in the future. Write short sentences. If sentences get too long, consider splitting them up into shorter sentences. Keep headings short (only one line). Table 3. Shortness is key No Yes 3.1 Hints on how to maintain the printer 3.1 Printer maintenance Due to the fact that they were able to come to an agreement, a name changing of the file took place.

Do not use words like \"basically\", \"actually\", \"very\", \"practically\", …​ Use 'that' and 'which' to express the information level: 'that' adds essential information, no commas are used. 'which' adds information that can be left out, commas are used. Table 9. Precision matters No Yes The rule I follow The rule that I follow The vehicle that is red drives down the road. The vehicle, which is red, drives down the road. Stick to one spelling for a word that allows several spellings (e-mail, email, E-mail). Stick to one style to present information (steps always as numbered lists). Stick to one formatting for a special purpose (first use of technical term: italic) Adoc-templates are available for common types of topics. Use them to create consistent content. Each template contains instructions on how to use the template and sample text that has to be replaced. Currently available templates: Generic Task UML element Use case Insert a line break after each sentence. No manual line breaks inside sentences. ⇒ \"Only hit 'enter' after a period ('.'), but make sure to hit 'enter' after a period.\" 1 This is the first sentence. 2 This is the second sentence. 3 This is the third sentence. Use paragraphs to structure your text. A new thought or statement requires a new paragraph. An empty line creates a new paragraph. 1 This is the first sentence of the first paragraph. 2 This is the second sentence of the first paragraph. 3 4 This is the first sentence of the second paragraph. In headings and captions, only the first word begins with an uppercase letter (sentence-style capitalization). Exception: Acronyms and proper names are spelled as is. Table 10. Use of uppercase in headings and captions No Yes Wrong Formatting of a Heading Correct formatting of a heading Asam rules to follow ASAM rules to follow Scope of OpenScenario Scope of OpenSCENARIO Use only lowercase for file and folder names. Use the underscore _ instead of 'space' in file and folder names. Use .adoc as file ending for documents. Table 11. Use of uppercase and underscores in file and folder names No Yes ExampleFileName.adoc example_file_name.adoc Another file name.adoc another_file_name.adoc Writing_guide.adoc writing_guide.adoc Use four space characters per indentation level.

No Yes Normal text →Level 1 indented text →→Level 2 indented text Normal text …​.Level 1 indented text …​…​..Level 2 indented text All topics, figures, tables and code examples shall have a unique tag. Sections may also have a tag if a link to the section is needed. Note: If you cannot come up with a document-wide unique id, just add [#tag-uid]. This triggers a pipeline warning and the technical writer can help you. Examples: [#top-uid] [#fig-uid] [#tab-uid] [#code-uid] [#sec-uid] You can generate a UUID using a generator like https://www.uuidgenerator.net/. Text sections (paragraphs or blocks of text) in the documentation of a standard are considered normative. If some text sections should be considered as non-normative and only descriptive (for example, background information or examples), mark this sections deliberately as non-normative. Non-normative sections shall be marked with the user-defined asciidoc role non-normative. Put the role attribute [.non-normative] in front of single paragraphs or blocks to mark them as non-normative. Inside a normative section use [.non-normative]## to mark single text passages as non-normative. Example for normative and non-normative sections This is a normative paragraph. [.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph. ==== This is a normative block. ==== [.non-normative] ==== This is a descriptive block. ==== This is another normative paragraph. This sentence is normative. [.non-normative]#This sentence is non-normative.# This sentence is normative again. Roles can be combined using the following syntax: [..]. Example with multiple roles [.important.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph that is also marked with the important-role. Id and role attributes can be combined. Use the long notation for easier reading: [id=, role=]. Example with role and id combined [id=top-doc-unique-id, role=non-normative] = Document title This is a descriptive, non-normative document. The actual format and style of non-normative sections depends on the entry in the CSS style sheet file that is used for rendering the text and is not coded in the adoc-file itself. Example of a CSS entry for non-normative text .non-normative { font-style: italic; color: darkgreen; background: gold } Lists are a great way to present lots of similar information in a compact form. Use the same word/sentence structure for all list items. Use numbered lists (Asciidoc '.') for steps that require a specific order. Use bullet points (Asciidoc '*') for enumerations and elements that do not require a specific order. A numbered list example . First step . Second step . Third step First step Second step Third step Table 13. Bullet point list example 'ingredients' No Yes first 2 apples, then one banana. And you need an orange too! two apples one banana one orange Figures, like pictures or drawings, may be used to illustrate complex facts. Preferred format: .svg Figures are stored in a subfolder named images located inside the chapter folder. Each figure shall have: a tag a caption the link to the picture an alternative text [#fig-uuid] .This is the caption of the figure image::logo.png[an alternative text] Figure 1. This is the caption of the figure Use tables if you have to present a huge amount of similar data in a very compressed form. A table shall have: a tag a caption [#tab-uuid] .This is the caption of the table |=== |cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3 |cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3 |cell 3_1 | cell 3_2 | cell 3_3 |=== Table 14. This is the caption of the table cell 1_1 cell 1_2 cell 1_3 cell 2_1 cell 2_2 cell 2_3 cell 3_1 cell 3_2 cell 3_3 Sometimes you may need to display a character that is reserved for adoc-formatting. Here is how to do it. Underscore (_) Use _ to display an underscore. Pound sign (#) Use # to display a pound sign. Protected space ( ) Use {nbsp} to define a space character is not used for automatic line breaks. This is especially useful for value-unit-pairs like 5{nbsp}m/s (5 m/s) to ensure that value and unit are always in the same line of text. Consider one of the following possibilities if you want to add source code examples to an adoc topic. You may use small bits of code as an inline literal directly inside your text. You may add source code as a fragment from a source code file by reference. You may copy and paste source code directly as a snippet into the adoc topic. For very small bits of code using inline literals is the most convenient way to add source code examples. This type of including source code is especially useful if you want to highlight single code elements like methods or class names. Enclose the source code in a pair of pluses surrounded by a pair of backticks, like this: Call the `+source_example_func()+` for the result. The previous line looks like this as adoc output: Call the source_example_func() for the result. You can add source code as a fragment from a source code file if you would like to reference to the source code within the source code file. There are several advantages of using fragments: You do not need to copy the source code into the documentation. You are referencing to the single point of truth, which is the source code file. If you apply changes to the source code file, these changes are automatically applied to your documentation. Follow these steps to add source code fragments to your documentation: Add source comment tags at the beginning and the end of the part of code you want to use in your code block. Use this tag to include the fragment into the adoc documentation. The example in the following subchapters uses the tag exampleInclude to add a code fragment. Tags for the inclusion of source code from a source code file [...] // tag::exampleInclude[] (1) (2) function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor /examplecode.js[tags=exampleInclude] (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block You can reference this anchor using > 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Directly include the source code within the source code file with a tag marking fragment. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. For more information see the Asciidoctor reference. This is how the reference looks like inside the adoc file: ASAM example code block included by tags function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block. Reference this anchor using > 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Insert the code block. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. This is how the correctly configured snippet looks like in the adoc file: ASAM example code block included in an asciidoc file Use [source, osc2] as a source block identifier for fragments and snippets (see example) to define the language type as 'osc2'. This enables future automatic syntax highlighting. The project uses the adoc attribute draft to steer the review process. This FAQ helps you to manage the review and attribute handling. Q1 What is this draft-attribute for? New content on the trunk has to be marked with the ifdef::draft[] - endif::draft[] 'feature flag' mechanism. New content in this case means content in adoc files that is not already reviewed and agreed on, like newly merged text from a development branch. A typical adoc topic looks like this: [#top-an-example-topic] = Topic heading ifdef::draft[] Some content that is new or still needs to be reviewed and agreed on. endif::draft[] Some other content that is already reviewed and ready for being part of the standard documentation. When a review is started, a WG-Lead or a member of the CCB removes the draft-mechanism for the part that has to be reviewed in the review merge request. Q2 I cannot see my content in the preview. What is wrong?:: You may experience an empty preview in your editor when editing files that contain the mechanism. + This is actually a good sign. The preview is working correctly and hides all parts marked as draft. + To make the parts visible again, you have to set the attribute draft for your preview window. In the Asciidoc extension settings go to Preview:Attributes - Edit in settings.json. In the settings.json add the draft attribute: \"asciidoc.preview.attributes\": { \"draft\": \"\" } Save settings.json Go to Settings on the right hand side of the preview Go to the Preview settings tab Add an Asciidoctor Attribute by double-clicking an empty attribute line Add attribute draft with value true Save the settings (small button on the lower left of the tab!) Reload the preview Other tools should have similar settings. The preview in Gitlab intentionally shows the release version of the files, meaning that the parts marked as draft are hidden. You can easily switch off the preview and view the source content by clicking on the display source-icon on top of the file window: Figure 2. How to switch to source-view in Gitlab The icon next to it switches back to the preview. Q3 My preview looks fine. Why do I get feedback that something is not formatted correctly?:: Please note that all the previews described in this chapter are just for your convenience. The only reliable documents for reviews are the html-artifacts generated by the CI-pipeline! These artifacts are linked at the beginning of review merge requests. You can also download the artifacts directly from the pipeline result page. For a short introduction to Asciidoc, see the https://code.asam.net/simulation/resources/-/blob/master/asciidoc_tutorial/asciidoc_tutorial.adoc. The adoc-templates can be found here. For a guide on how to format code examples see the https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/blob/master/Documentation/etc/guides/coding_style_guide.adoc. Topics for entities of the domain model can be automatically created if the UML diagrams contain specially formatted comments.

Versionable and diffable – i.e. we can tell who did what, when, and where! In the end, we can deliver an interactive html instead of a static pdf If you want to learn more about AsciiDoc, see the following links: Quick reference User manual Besides the general syntax, ASAM standards follow specific ASAM guidelines for AsciiDoc. These are listed below. For most cases, Draw.io shall be used. It’s a possibility to generate graphics with a powerful tool that can be included directly, without a intermediate image format.

The addition of \"^\" at the end of the link name does the same in a shorthand version. For example: AsciiDoc Result image:logo.png[alt=A button titled ASAM Home,link=https://asam.net,window=_blank] You might want to draw attention to certain statements by creating notes or tips - so-called admonitions. Use each of these sparingly. You don’t want to create pages that are full of notes and tips. They become less meaningful if you do. Here’s what each of these looks like when the AsciiDoc content is turned into HTML: This is a note. It includes extra info that a reader might need to know. Here’s a tip. A tip provides useful information that can help a user do something or understand something. This is important information that the reader must be aware of so they don’t do something that they shouldn’t. A caution advises the reader to act carefully. Use this in rare circumstances. And this is a warning that informs of danger or harm. This one should be used very rarely, as well. If you’re authoring new content, you’ll want to review this section for some nitty-gritty details. If you’re explaining how to perform a task, you might include introductory information before you get to the steps. And you might need to say what to do after completing the steps. If you do, it’s best to organize that information using headers, which enables scanning. Use the following headings as needed: AsciiDoc Result .What you'll need _The information the user needs to complete the task._ .About this task _Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task._ .Steps _The individual steps to complete the task._ .What's next? _What the user should do next._ What you’ll need The information the user needs to complete the task. About this task Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task. Steps The individual steps to complete the task. What’s next? What the user should do next. Each of these should include a . right before the text, like so: .What you'll need .About this task .Steps .What's next? This syntax applies bold text in a larger font. This section shows how to include code blocks in an ASAM standard. In the standard case, a fragment direcly from a source code file is included, to not have duplicated code in the document. This is shown in chapter [Code as fragment from source code file]. In some cases, e.g. examples, it is also possible to direcly include code in the documentation. This is shown in chapter Code as snippet in document.

If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here. Remind people about their man-day commitments, too. Keep the discussion focused on topic Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic But let the discussion go for a while Drive discussion towards results/decisions (not towards own/right results/decisions) Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution Do not let the discussion become repetitive In case discussions are very controversial Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has been said, carry out a vote. If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something \"might not work\" or​ \"could be too slow\"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known. If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g. propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone ​ carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​ propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort) Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority. Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority. In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down Ask a member or the Service Provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic. In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on. Moderator takes the initiative and drives the discussion forward with his own proposals.

A standard package consists of at least one base standard. Other deliverable items, as listed on this page, are optional. Base standard A base standard contains all fundamental specifications such as abstract object models, syntax definitions and functional behavior descriptions. It uses a problem- or task-oriented notation, such as UML or BNF. A base standard is technology- and implementation-independent. Each ASAM standard consists of one base standard document. Some base standards at ASAM are split-up into two documents, which is the Reference Guide, which contains all formal specifications of the standard in a reference-book style, and the User’s Guide, which further specifies the application of the standard. All other standard documents within a standard package are associated to the base standard, and are of one of the following types: Companion standard The notion of companion standard is typically used for application- or device-specific extensions of a base standard. Technology reference Technology references map the abstract specifications of the base standard to specific technologies, e.g. programming langages or data-base implementations. Transport Layer Specification Transport layer specifications are similar to technology references, as they also provide a technology mapping. The notion of transport layer specification is used in the area of communication technologies. They provide a mapping of the base standard to specific protocol- or bus-technologies. The transport layer abstracts access of higher application layers to the lower layers of the communication system. Model files Model files typically contain the object model of the standard. A typical example of a model file in ASAM standards are UML models created with the tool \"Enterprise Architect\" (.ea). Schema files Schema files define the formal structure and syntax of text files. They are used for automated schema validation. Typical examples of schema files are XML definition files (.xsd) or Google protocol buffers definition files (.proto). Interface definition files Interface definition files define programmatic interfaces, such as APIs (Application Programming Interface). They are used for automatic code generation of the standardized interface for specific programming languages. A typical example of an interface definition file is the Interface Description Language file (.idl). Example files Example files demonstrate a typical and standard-compliant implementation of the standard.","title":"ASAM Deliverables","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"deliverables","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Guidelines/deliverables.html","titles":[{"text":"Standard documents","hash":"_standard_documents","id":1},{"text":"Other files","hash":"_other_files","id":2}]},"280":{"id":280,"text":"This Project Guide uses a variation of BPMN 2.0 diagrams to describe the ASAM Project Phases.

They are a formal and complete representation of the respective project phase or step. Example diagram based on the Ideation Phase shows an example based on the Ideation Phase. Figure 1. Example diagram based on the Ideation Phase 1 The phase starts 2 The first activity in the phase is the person with the idea (the \"Idea Giver\") sending an email with their project idea to the ASAM Office 3 This is where the path branches: if the idea is a new standard, it will continue with event 4, otherwise with event 5 4 In case this is a new standard, the ASAM Office will initiate an Ideation Workshop together with the Idea Giver to add further details to the idea before deciding on whether to progress to the Proposal phase or disregard the idea. The Workshop is created using the provided (4a) Ideation Workshop gameplan. 5 Whether the idea is a new standard or not, the Idea Giver has to raise enough interest to gather the required amount of participants for the Proposal phase, which is at least 3. He keeps the ASAM Office informed about the status, and the ASAM Office may support by bringing the Idea Giver in contact with potentially interested parties at ASAM. 6 Once the requirements for entering the next phase have been fulfilled, the project may enter the Proposal phase. The details of each step of a phase are explained on separate child pages under the page containing the full diagram. In the example above, one child page would cover the activity of how to propose an idea, another page would cover the ideation workshop, and a final page would cover tips on how to find participants for a Project Proposal.

Modifier comments class and_another_class { modify_xy() /'adoc-modifier ./path/to/fragment/thing_modify_xy.adoc '/ } Follow these steps to add documentation: Add adoc-comments to plantuml files. Commit and push plantuml files to gitlab. Make sure to adhere to the Commit message conventions. The pipeline then runs the script and adoc fragments are created automatically. If you want to exclude a uml-file from being analyzed, insert /'adoc-fileignore'/ at the beginning of the uml-file. Example 6. Exculding files @startuml foo /'adoc-fileignore'/ class bar { ... } @enduml If you want to check the content of the created fragments, you can download them as a pipeline artifact. Depending on which Gitlab page you are using you can find the artifacts at different places. Use the download button on the pipeline continuous integration page. Figure 1.

The following sections contain some suggestions for project-specific labels. If a project wants to use additional custom labels for extra filter options, each label must be documented in the project documentation and be accessible to each project member. All ASAM projects have their individual work packages clustered into groups or categories. These labels are defined individually for each project and should be used to categorize issues. An issue can have multiple Group and Work Package labels provided that it is relevant to more than one of these. ASAM suggest the following naming schema for group/category labels: Suggested workgroup label schema 'isWorkgroup':'Workgroup' Rules Remove spaces (\"Domain Model\" instead of \"DomainModel\") Example An issue label for the group Domain Model (DomainModel) would be 'isWorkgroup:DomainModel' This part contains all labels specific to the Proposal phase. Note that these come with the template repository and typically need not be added manually. Each issue targeting the Proposal document shall be assigned: Label Description isPhase:Proposal Denotes that this issue is relevant for the Proposal document. Milestones specify target dates and development phases for topics. Projects organize their issues by assigning them to milestones created separately. Each project has their own set of milestones that correspond to the milestone planning for the current project phase.

For example, if user A deletes a section in their copy and user B adds a new paragraph to it instead, the merging tool does not know whether to keep the section and add the changes made by user B or to delete it like user A did. One way of avoiding merge conflicts is to keep the TTL (time to live) of branches short. ASAM recommends a TTL of ⇐ 2 weeks. If the branch lives longer than expected, merge the parent branch (the trunk or original feature branch) into your branch once in a while. Alternatively, you can also rebase your branch to the parent branch again. This way you can solve the conflicts in your branch. For more information on the differences between merging and rebasing, see Merging vs. Rebasing. Once you create a merge request, your remote repository will tell you if there are merge conflicts. It leads you through the conflicting parts and lets you choose if your new or the old content is to be merged. Another option is to merge locally. You can use Git or Visual Studio Code for this. These tools also provide options to view conflicting changes and help you resolve them. After you have removed the conflicts, you can create a new commit to your branch that includes the fixes to resolve the conflict in the Merge/Pull Request.

ASAM and the CI pipelines in the remote repositories, however, require one, depending on the current project phase. A project MUST create a tag in the following instances: Any time a document has to be shared outside the project, i.e. The document of this repository is to be released/published or submitted to TSC A review is to be started A major milestone has been hit and its progress has to be specifically documented Only tagged (i.e. versioned) documents may be shared officially outside the project group.

This is called the \"Issue Triage\" or \"Ticket Triage\". See Ticket triage for more details. Closed issues can be reopened if they have become relevant again, there have been new developments directly impacting this specific issue, or the issue has been closed by accident and has not actually been finished yet.","title":"Contributing through issues","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"workflow-contribute_with_issues","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Guidelines/workflow-contribute_with_issues.html","titles":[{"text":"1 Make discussions accessible","hash":"_make_discussions_accessible","id":1},{"text":"2 Gather topics in issues","hash":"_gather_topics_in_issues","id":2},{"text":"2.1 Sub-issues","hash":"_sub_issues","id":3},{"text":"2.2 Closing issues and sub-issues","hash":"_closing_issues_and_sub_issues","id":4},{"text":"3 Use issue templates","hash":"_use_issue_templates","id":5},{"text":"4 Define issue name","hash":"_define_issue_name","id":6},{"text":"5 Label issues correctly","hash":"_label_issues_correctly","id":7},{"text":"6 Discuss issue","hash":"_discuss_issue","id":8},{"text":"6.1 Content","hash":"_content","id":9},{"text":"6.2 Comments","hash":"_comments","id":10},{"text":"6.3 Replies","hash":"_replies","id":11},{"text":"7 Close issues","hash":"_close_issues","id":12},{"text":"8 The issue triage","hash":"_the_issue_triage","id":13},{"text":"9 Reopening issues","hash":"_reopening_issues","id":14}]},"298":{"id":298,"text":"In ASAM projects, tasks are divided into individual issues.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users cannot commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in development or feature branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another feature branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Users MAY branch off the trunk for more focused development work. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label {requires:Clarification} to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label {isStatus:Duplicate} and assign the {role-wg-lead} The WG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to {requires:Clarification} and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue, applying the Branch Naming Conventions Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to {requires:ConceptualWork} to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch, adhering to the Commit Message Conventions Review implementation progress of issue with {role-wg-lead} and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Work Group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to {requires:CCBReview} If changes were developed in draft sections, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to {isStatus:WontBeFixed} and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Both tips reduce the chance for Merge Conflicts. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident. Mark passages which are not ready for viewing in the final output as draft (see Mark passages as draft) The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'.

In the case that questions lead to significant changes to the content, the MR is reopened for review on resolution. On completion of the integration: Set the status label of the Merge/Pull Request to {requires:CCBReview} Set to squash commits with fast-forward merging (default). Squash commit message MUST adhere to the Commit Message Conventions Who CCB Steps CCB performs a final review of the integrated content Is the original content still correctly represented? Are all guidelines & conventions maintained? Are all discussions resolved? Does it have a clear commit history that adheres to the Commit message conventions? If the review is not passed, return to [Integration] If the review is passed and the CCB can merge, the CCB merges the Merge/Pull Request back to the trunk The CCB removes the status label and closes the linked issue If the review is passed but the CCB may not merge, the CCB changes the status label to {requires:Merge} Tips Use a pull request for code reviews.

This guide describes how to create a button for sending reviews with a custom body using the \"supplemental_ui/partials/header-content.hbs\" file. It also explains the basic syntax of a button and links to external references for available attributes. The outline of the idea is: Add a button to the header supplemental Point the href to your target url (email or page) Add the required parameters like title and body after a ? What parameters are available depends on your target. For example, for the GitLab Service Desk, you must add the issue template in text-form as body here. For the GitHub URL query, you can choose to either append a template file (markdown) or add the it directly as body. The href attribute value must be a valid url, i.e. be url encoded. You can use an encoder like this one to encode your body. Each UI button follows this syntax: Button name target the location the button leads to (e.g. email address, page url) attribute1,2, …​ attribute passed on to the target (supported types depend on target) value1,2, …​ value assigned to the corresponding target Tooltip text the text displayed when the user hovers over the button with their mouse Button name the text printed on the button This is usually used for GitLab.

The Antora output has been built locally. Docker must be installed and running. To use the provided script, Python must be installed (during installation, check the box \"Add Python [version] to PATH\"). The generator repository for your project has been checked out. For development projects, the generator repository is located here: https://code.asam.net/internal/examples/antora-base-repo-example Check the generator’s 'site.yml' configuration For local builds, the url under content/sources must be local. Typically, this is \"./foldername\", where \"foldername\" is the name of the folder the content was checked out into Ensure that you use the branches and/or tags you want to build Run the scripts/build.py Python script: python scripts/build.py → The generated page automatically opens in the browser (Chrome). To build the content without opening it automatically, add -s after \"build.py\" To reopen the last build, add -f after \"build.py\" To get more information on possible options, type -h after \"build.py\" The example below shows the differences between a remote build setup and a local build setup. All changes are applied in the project’s site.yml. Remote build Local build Build using the GitHub repository, the branches \"main\" and \"pre-restructuring\", and all tagged versions starting with \"v\". Use the folder \"content\" in the repository for this content source. content: sources: - url: https://github.com/asam-ev/asam-project-guide-content.git # - url: ./asam-project-guide-content branches: main, pre-restructuring # branches: main tags: v* start_path: content Build using the local folder \"asam-project-guide-content\" and only the branch \"main\". Use the folder \"content\" in the repository for this content source. content: sources: # - url: https://github.com/asam-ev/asam-project-guide-content.git - url: ./asam-project-guide-content # branches: main, pre-restructuring branches: main # tags: v* start_path: content The most likely reason here is that you are trying to build two separate branches or tags that have identical component descriptors (typically, these are named \"antora.yml\"). The default component descriptor applies automatic versioning based on git values. However, some configuration may lead to two separate branches or tags getting the same version in Antora. In this case, update at least one of the impacted component descriptors so that its version is different from the other. To do so, you can either set a manual value or update the rules that are applied the refname. The script must be executed from the correct folder. Navigate to the folder where the script is located. Open a terminal window Execute 'python build.py' Unfortunately, there are some features that will not be available without python (i.e. the custom macros and summary features). If you cannot use python for whatever reason, you may use a python docker container and run everything from within there. If you had already set up the Antora image with the one-time step docker-compose build antora before and it stopped working, there is a chance that some technical changes have been made. To switch to the newest setup, run 'docker-compose down' to stop any currently running docker-compose, delete the image related to the project-guide antora setup (e.g. \"asam-project-guide_antora\") with the docker rmi command (see docker rmi --help for more information) You might need to force the deletion! prune the volume used by antora re-do the \"only required once\" steps Any program that blocks the site folder will stop Antora from generating the new pages. The reason is that it needs to delete the existing folder first before the new content is then written into it. Make sure that no program is currently accessing and blocking files or folders from the \"./site\" path.

In case a new project is proposed, the first step is to create an Executive Draft for internal analysis. Based on this draft, a rough Proposal Draft is then created that contains further details needed for the Proposal Workshop. This Proposal Draft is later further expanded and detailed until it is ready for submission to the TSC. The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be. A valid Project Proposal is created that can be brought to decision by the TSC. The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files, but the initial executive draft may be a Word document. For proposal submission, the proposal document must be converted into the appropriate Asciidoc structure. The idea has been proposed and approved in the Ideation Phase. The proposal needs at least three (3) partner companies. Access the project’s online repository through the link provided by your GTM Optionally, check out the project repository or download the Executive Draft template and edit the AsciiDoc files directly. You must update the content of each chapter’s issue regardless of if you write in the AsciiDoc files directly or not!

Promoting specific commercial tools shall be avoided. Repository suffix Implementation An implementation project has the purpose to create a supplementary product that supports the ap-plication of an ASAM standard in the industry. An ASAM product shall cover one of the following use-cases: supports the development of standard-based, commercial products(e.g. development tool kit) ensures standard-based interoperability of commercial products(e.g. source code) reduce the development costs of commercial products(e.g. source code) is used for testing the standard compliance of commercial products(e.g. checker tool, test suite, source code) Another auxiliary purpose of an implementation project can be to support the standard development by providing feedback from the implementers to the standard developers to improve the quality and maturity of the standard while it is still in development. For liability reasons, ASAM shall develop and distribute source code only as a result of an implementation project. Members may use the source code to create tools or other executables from the source code. As an example, implementation projects may include the development of source code for one of the following products. This list is not exhaustive and should only serve as a guideline of what might be a meaningful, supplementary product to an ASAM standard. Checker tool for syntax checks of non-schema-based file formats Checker tool for plausibility checks of schema-based file formats Checker tool for API checks Add-on or plug-in for de-facto standard IDEs (e.g. MATLAB, Simulink, Eclipse etc.) Importers or parsers Exporters or generators Reference implementations of tools or tool components Behavioral software components Additions to popular open-source projects (e.g. Eclipse, openMDM, Artop, etc.) API stubs and skeletons The deliverable(s) of an implementation project must have product-quality. Consequently, ASAM products are professionally developed in accordance to customary quality guidelines of the automotive or IT industries, whichever is applicable. This requires that the software is developed by a contractor, while the ASAM project group controls and reviews the contractor’s implementation. For example, schemata definition files shall be commented. Further rules and guidelines for this project type are set forth in the document \"GuidelinesForASAMCheckerTools\". Upon request, ASAM provides funding up to 100% of the project’s required budget. Excluded are expenses for meeting participation and travel.

The following process steps are not mandatory and are skipped by default, unless otherwise decided by the TSC or the project group: P1: Proposal Workshop C: Review Phase When members propose the further development of a standard, for which an ASAM product exists, members must also propose the further development of this product, unless the pro-posed changes of the standard have no impact on the product. If the ASAM product shall not be further developed, then ASAM shall publicly announce that the development of the product is discontinued. ASAM products shall not compete with a member company’s product business(non-competition clause).

In these, workgroup members define the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated). Goal The goal is to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. Repository suffix Standard All variants use the same repository suffix. The core of ASAM is to carry out standard development projects with the goal to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. ASAM defines four types of standard development projects, depending on the expected magnitude of changes to the standard: New standard Major version update Minor version update Revision They all have in common that the primary output of the project is a standard. The upper limit for subsidiary funding from ASAM is 25% of the total required project budget. Table 1. Summary Purpose Create a new standard. Version 1.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A new standard is developed from the outset. There is no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio, or the predecessor has been declared as 'deprecated'. A new ASAM standard can be a transfer from another organization or an extension of a standard from another standardization organization. Start the development of a completely new standard within ASAM. The development project meets one of the following criteria: There exists no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio. A predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio was deprecated and a new standard in the same technology area shall be developed from scratch. The new standard is an extension, substitution or parallel development of a standard from another standardization organization. A new ASAM standard gets the version number \"1.0.0\". If a new standard replaces a deprecated standard, then the new standard cannot have the same name than the deprecated standard. Table 2. Summary Purpose Add major features Make significant changes to existing features Version X.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A major version development project introduces significant changes to the standard, e.g. the addition of a new major feature or significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor. Major version developments of ASAM standards introduce significant changes to the standard. Major version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Addition of a new, major feature. Significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor versions. The number of major version releases meets the pattern: \"X.0.0\". X is an integer number starting with 2. Table 3.

It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Minor version developments of ASAM standards introduce changes t existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard. Minor version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Addition of new features, which are considered as small relative to existing features. Insignificant changes or additions to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A new minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: \"?.X.0\".

Summary Purpose Correct errors Remove ambiguities Add clarifications Make editorial improvements Change/add examples Version ?.?.X New Features n.a Backward compatible yes Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase A revision version development project resolves technical issues of the standard, i.e. corrects errors, removes ambiguities, adds clarifications to existing descriptions, makes editorial improvements or changes examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. A new revision version of an ASAM standard is always backward-compatible. Revision version developments of ASAM standards resolve technical issues with the currently released version of the standard. Revision version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Correction of errors. Removal of ambiguities. Addition of clarifications to existing descriptions. Editorial improvements. Any kind of changes to examples, including the addition of examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration ef-forts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. The only exception is, that a new feature has been forgotten in an earlier release of the standard and is absolutely required for a functional and meaningful standard. A new revision version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. The only exception is, that the correction of an error or the removal of an ambiguity cannot be reasonably solved in any other way than breaking the backward-compatibility. An exception requires approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Revision development projects may be converted to a minor or major version development project during the course of the project term, if backward-compatibility issues turn out to be too severe or new features need to be added. The TSC has to approve this change of project type. Only those ASAM members, who were actively involved in development of the preceding major or minor version, can participate in the revision development project. Revision projects are limited to a life cycle of up to 18 months. Unlike other project types, the paid Service Provider for a revision project can be contracted without a public request for quotation. The Service Provider is confirmed by the TSC and is appointed before the project starts. The Project Leader and the Service Provider must be employees from different companies. The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: \"?.?.X\". X is an integer number starting with 1. ? represents the current major and minor release number.

Study projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards among the participants, to promote their application in member companies and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards. This project type is specifically intended for members in regions, where ASAM standards are not well known. The content of study projects can be, but is not limited to: collaborative self-study of an ASAM standard receive training on an ASAM standard carry out a suitability analysis of an ASAM standard against defined use-cases carry out a pilot project to become familiar with the practical application of ASAM-related tools carry out an interoperability analysis of ASAM-related tools Study projects have no expected deliverables other than a final report. The members of study projects shall be pledged to submit change requests, if they find issues or gaps in ASAM standards. The standard development process does not apply for study projects in case that either no budget or a small budget is needed. The process to request, approve and carrying out a study project is: Member submits a study project information sheet to the ASAM Office for project approval. ASAM Office checks the information and approves or rejects the project. ASAM Office informs the TSC about the project. ASAM Office publishes an announcement of the project. The study project starts and is being carried out as described in the study project information sheet. The ASAM Office monitors the project activities. Some further rules apply for study projects: Participation in study projects is open for all ASAM members, e.g. also to members in a non \"active\"membership class. Participation in a study project can be restricted to members of a specific region, e.g. Japan only. The working language can be different than English. The project members elect a Project Leader. Meetings are documented via meeting minutes in English language. The minutes may be translated into the working language of the study group. The project members use the ASAM IT infrastructure. Upon request, ASAM provides funding for study projects up to the limit for small budget projects.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 By making a contribution to this project, I certify that: (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as Indicated in the file; or (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it. (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved. The DCO requires a sign-off message in the following format appear on each commit in the pull request: Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname The DCO text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either -s or --signoff to your usual Git commit commands. If you forget to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit with the sign-off by running git commit --amend -s. You can add sign-offs to multiple commits (including commits originally authored by others, if you are authorized to do so) using git rebase --signoff. If you’ve pushed your changes to GitHub already you’ll need to force push your branch after this with git push --force-with-lease. If you want to be reminded to add the sign-off for commits in your repository, you can add the following commit-message git hook to your repository: #!/bin/sh # = Check for DCO/Signed-off-by in message # if ! grep -q \"^Signed-off-by: \" \"$1\" then echo \"Aborting commit: Commit message is not signed off\" >&2 exit 1 fi Placing this script into a file called .git/hooks/commit-msg and making it executable (e.g. using chmod a+x .git/hooks/commit-msg on unixoid operating systems) will prevent commits that do not have a sign-off.

TECHNICAL WRITER SERVICE PROVIDER Docker is a platform where you use so-called containers to run applications in an encapsulated environment. With this, you do not need to install and configure software, programming languages etc: just download and use a pre-configured container that has all the relevant configuration already built in. From the docker homepage: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Figure 1. The Docker architecture For Asciidoc, docker can be used to run a pre-configured asciidoctor setup for creating html output locally. This removes the need to upload adoc files and use the build pipeline for every change you want to see. It also means you do not have to install and configure Asciidoctor first since this is already done in the pre-configured Docker image. If you do not have Docker installed, check out the Docker before continuing. If your project is currently missing the docker-compose.yml, see these Standard Docker-Compose YAML on how to set it up. A project’s final specification document is created as HTML file. However, having to run it through the pipeline every time before being able to see the final result after having made changes is neither efficient nor friendly to the other workgroup members. To render a project’s documentation without having to upload it, use Docker Compose with a correctly defined docker-compose.yml file.

After the goals for the cycle have been defined and the issues created, estimated, and assigned, all involved project members, technical writers and Service Providers contribute to development in accordance with the Trunk-based Remote Repositories. A typical cycle lasts for two (2) months. During this period, each WG will schedule one or more Work Group Meetings. Additionally, the Project Lead (and possibly the CCB) may meet with the WG Leads in one or more WG Lead Meetings. Finally, the CCB may schedule CCB Meetings. Note that each project decides on the frequency of each of these meetings for themselves during the project’s Kick-off Meeting. These intervals may be changed during the project if the group agrees to the suggested changes and the alterations are documented. A Development Cycle only consists of the project-internal activities, such as group meetings and content discussions. Topics that have an effect on the project or are affected by it are not included in the overall cycle structure. However, the project must still accommodate for these events. Two typical examples for these external events are TSC Controlling Meetings and CGSim Controlling Meetings, which have their own project-independent schedules and intervals. The Project Lead must make sure that the mandatory external meetings are accounted for in each Development Cycle.

This page covers the Development Cycle and all its sub-steps as well as participating in relevant Controlling Meetings. Each sub-step is further detailed on its respective page. Figure 1. The Development phase’s main cycle in detail, using the ASAM Project Phase Notation While the project is actively being developed, it follows the main development cycle of planning, developing, and reviewing. Occasionally, there are project-independent events happening, such as \"Controlling Meetings\", where each project may or must participate in. In particular, there are the CGSim Controlling Meetings (mandatory for all Simulation Domain projects during the Development phase) and the TSC Controlling Meetings. Typically, projects present their current (i.e. the latest updated) status report to allow the respective panel to monitor and intervene, if necessary. Each project defines their own timeline during the Proposal phase. Therefore, there is no standard Development phase timeline. However, there are typical categories for project length. These are shown below. Additionally, a project may request additional time if the project’s content turns out to be more complex than anticipated. The Development phase consists of the following steps, which are explained in detail in their own sections: Cycle planning Cycle development Cycle review Controlling Meetings TSC Controlling Meeting CGSim Controlling Meeting Purpose To plan the next development cycle on both a high and a low level in form of a milestone Responsible PROJECT LEAD + CCB Member; {role-wg-lead} Involved {role-wg-lead}; PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER This is a multi-step task. The Project Lead, together with the CCB, specifies the high level goals for the project’s next development cycle. They then present and discuss the created milestone with the WG Leads. After the overall goals have been specified and communicated, the WG Leads specify the detailed goals for the respective involved Working Groups. They then present and discuss both the global and the detailed goals of the milestone with the WG members, the involved Service Providers, and the Technical Writers. See Development cycle — Planning. Purpose To develope the content for the planned milestone. Responsible PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER Involved PROJECT LEAD, {role-wg-lead} This is a multi-step task. During the development cycle, each work group individually works on their respective topics (if any). Each work group will also meet regularly in its Work Group Meetings. Note that each work group may define the intervals and modalities of their meetings for themselves. To coordinate activities between different Work Groups, ASAM recommends that all WG Leads meet regularly during each cycle. Each project may define their own intervals for WG Lead meetings. In addition to that, the CCB may meet regularly or triggered by specific events to review and merge urgent topics as well as discuss other project-related topics. Similarly to the Work Group Meetings, each project may define their own intervals for CCB meetings. See Development cycle — Development. Purpose To review the achievements for the planned milestone and to create a project status report. Responsible PROJECT LEAD + CCB Member; {role-wg-lead} Involved {role-wg-lead}; PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER Each cycle ends with a project meeting where the project process is assessed and the project status report is updated. The project status is then presented at the next CGSim Controlling Meeting. See Development cycle — Review. This is a Full Project Meeting. The Full project meeting/workshop guidelines apply. Purpose To discuss how the latest cycle went and find out, whether processes can and must be improved or not. Responsible PROJECT LEAD Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER No process is perfect, and every initial assumption and definition may be imperfect. For this reason, ASAM recommends doing a Cycle Retrospective meeting after every cycle. The idea is to identify methods, processes, and topics that proved to work great and should be kept as well as topics that turned out to be inefficient or problematic and should be changed or improved. This way, each project can improve not only its content, but also its way of working together to become more efficient and increase their work quality over time. Ideally, these lessons learned are documented and, if generally applicable, used to improve this Project Guide around the project’s conclusion.

The Development phase’s setup step in detail, using the ASAM Project Phase Notation At the beginning of the Development phase, the project team gets together for a Kick-off Workshop. Here, the team decides on key topics of the project and also elects the Project Lead. In parallel to that, the GTM sets up the repository and the mailing list for the project. After the workshop has happened, the repository is updated with the outcomes from it. If the project has requested budget for one or more Service Providers, a call for offer is issued, potential Service Providers present their offers, and the project decides on whom to contract.

Additionally, the GTM may support with technical problems and questions regarding the used remote repository platform. The following topics need to be updated: Milestones Create Issues for all known topics Assign milestones and labels to issues Update timeline in README in repository Set up or update CI pipeline, if necessary After having assigned the correct roles, the Project Lead may delegate specific tasks to the WG Leads and/or the appointed CCB members.

Click here to learn more about how you can contribute to it directly. The Project Proposal is an AsciiDoc document laying out the proposed project for a new standard / version of a released standard. The Project Proposal template is located in the ASAM GitLab, where you can find more information on its structure and default content. Each proposal must cover the following topics: Commitments Project timeline Project deliverables Project structure Additional project funding Market analysis/relevance Relevance to ASAM Project type Prospect participants of the project must commit to it ahead of time. There are different types of commitments possible: Content commitment Review commitment Each type comes with requirements that are explained in their respective section. TODO TODO Each project must plan its own timeline ahead of time. Since things change, the timeline may be altered later. However, the timeline should still be realistic with the knowledge available during the proposal phase. The Project Timeline must contain milestones for each Project Deliverable and account for Kickoff Start of review End of review Finalization Presentation at TSC Target release date The duration of the plan shall not exceed 1.5 years. The proposal must define the deliverables it intends to hand over to ASAM at the end of the project. The deliverables of a standard package consist of standard documents and other files. A standard package consists of at least one base standard. Other deliverable items, as listed on this page, are optional. Base standard A base standard contains all fundamental specifications such as abstract object models, syntax definitions and functional behavior descriptions. It uses a problem- or task-oriented notation, such as UML or BNF. A base standard is technology- and implementation-independent. Each ASAM standard consists of one base standard document. Some base standards at ASAM are split-up into two documents, which is the Reference Guide, which contains all formal specifications of the standard in a reference-book style, and the User’s Guide, which further specifies the application of the standard. All other standard documents within a standard package are associated to the base standard, and are of one of the following types: Companion standard The notion of companion standard is typically used for application- or device-specific extensions of a base standard. Technology reference Technology references map the abstract specifications of the base standard to specific technologies, e.g. programming langages or data-base implementations. Transport Layer Specification Transport layer specifications are similar to technology references, as they also provide a technology mapping. The notion of transport layer specification is used in the area of communication technologies. They provide a mapping of the base standard to specific protocol- or bus-technologies. The transport layer abstracts access of higher application layers to the lower layers of the communication system. Model files Model files typically contain the object model of the standard. A typical example of a model file in ASAM standards are UML models created with the tool \"Enterprise Architect\" (.ea). Schema files Schema files define the formal structure and syntax of text files. They are used for automated schema validation. Typical examples of schema files are XML definition files (.xsd) or Google protocol buffers definition files (.proto). Interface definition files Interface definition files define programmatic interfaces, such as APIs (Application Programming Interface). They are used for automatic code generation of the standardized interface for specific programming languages. A typical example of an interface definition file is the Interface Description Language file (.idl). Example files Example files demonstrate a typical and standard-compliant implementation of the standard. The proposal must specify the expected working groups and their designated leads. The proposal must also define the expected roles (see ASAM roles for typical role specifications) in the project. The proposal must define whether additional funding beyond the standard budget calculation is required. The proposal must provide an initial market analysis and show the relevance for it. A standard without merit is not to be supported by ASAM. Similarly, a standard with (nearly) identical content as another standard is obsolete. TODO The proposal must specify the type of project it wants to start.","title":"The Proposal document","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"proposal_document","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/getting-involved/proposal/proposal_document.html","titles":[{"text":"Commitments","hash":"_commitments","id":1},{"text":"Content commitment","hash":"_content_commitment","id":2},{"text":"Review commitment","hash":"_review_commitment","id":3},{"text":"Project timeline","hash":"_project_timeline","id":4},{"text":"Project deliverables","hash":"_project_deliverables","id":5},{"text":"Standard documents","hash":"_standard_documents","id":6},{"text":"Other files","hash":"_other_files","id":7},{"text":"Project structure","hash":"_project_structure","id":8},{"text":"Additional project funding","hash":"_additional_project_funding","id":9},{"text":"Market analysis/relevance","hash":"_market_analysisrelevance","id":10},{"text":"Relevance to ASAM","hash":"_relevance_to_asam","id":11},{"text":"Project type","hash":"_project_type","id":12}]},"397":{"id":397,"text":"Responsible {role-gtm} Involved Idea Giver, PROJECT PARTICIPANT Step TL;DR Use the Proposal Workshop Gameplan Schedule the meeting >=4 weeks ahead of time Add event to website Reserve room/online meeting This page covers how to set up a proposal workshop. If you are interested in joining a listed workshop, check out Join a Proposal Workshop instead. The first major event in the Proposal phase is the Proposal Workshop. Here, the project idea is presented to a broader audience for the first time and discussed. The Idea Giver needs to prepare the event for it to be efficient and effective. ASAM provides a standard Proposal Workshop Gameplan to help with the preparation. Participants of the Proposal Workshop focus on the following topics, which are the technical core of the intended project proposal: Use-cases, from the view-point of end-users. Features, which shall be standardized. Requirements, to be considered during the development of the standard. Further items shall be discussed, which cover the proposal justification and project planning: a justification of market relevance for the proposed changes or the new standard. prioritization of features and requirements. statement about backward-compatibility, in case of the further development of an existing standard. The participants of the Proposal Workshop shall determine the proposal submitter. The Proposal Workshop is prepared at least 4 weeks ahead of time and listed on the ASAM website. For an onsite workshop, a sufficient meeting room has been booked at the ASAM office (max. duration: 8h). For an online workshop, an online event has been set up (max. duration: 4h).

The Project Proposal is a written document that is submitted to the TSC for project approval before any project at ASAM may start. All committed participants (the Idea Giver, the Proposal Submitter, and all prospective Workgroup Members) can participate in writing the proposal document (the Proposal Submitter actually has to participate in the finalization step). See The Proposal document for more information on the document and its intended contents. You must first complete the Minimum Required Setup before you can participate in and contribute to any project. Participation in the creation of a Project Proposal follows the central Trunk-based Workflow at ASAM. If you want to learn more about this workflow, click the link. To contribute to a Project Proposal, project members can either contribute through GitLab issues or contribute directly in AsciiDoc. However, at least one person must transfer all content to the AsciiDoc file eventually. Both ways of contribution can be performed without software installation directly through the respective web interface. If you prefer to work on your local computer, see the list of recommended tools. The content of a Proposal document shall be drafted and discussed through issues in the project’s issue board. ASAM provides guidelines on how to contribute through issues on the page Proposal phase contribution guidelines. All participants must follow these guidelines. The project may decide to contribute directly in AsciiDoc as well. However, content shall still be discussed and updated in issues as described in Contributing through issues. When writing AsciiDoc, writers must follow the guidelines described in Contributing in AsciiDoc files as well as the ASAM Editorial Guide. The content that is defined in the project’s issues must be transferred to AsciiDoc eventually. ASAM recommends that the project defines one or more writers responsible for this task. When writing AsciiDoc, writers must follow the guidelines described in Contributing in AsciiDoc files as well as the ASAM Editorial Guide. ASAM provides an Editorial Guide containing the writing guidelines applicable to all ASAM documents. The current version of the Editorial Guide is located in the Project Guide Compendium. The Editorial Guide is mandatory for all Technical Writers and recommended for users contributing content through issues. Responsible Idea Giver Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, {role-gtm} Step TL;DR Write the Motivation section Define use cases Refer to known existing standards Fill in all technical chapters Discuss and optimize together with ASAM Office The ASAM Office assists the writer(s) by giving advice with respect to ASAM guideline and best practices. In case a new project is proposed, the first step is to create an Executive Draft for internal analysis. Based on this draft, a rough Proposal Draft is then created that contains further details needed for the Proposal Workshop. This Proposal Draft is later further expanded and detailed until it is ready for submission to the TSC. The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be. A valid Project Proposal is created that can be brought to decision by the TSC. The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files, but the initial executive draft may be a Word document. For proposal submission, the proposal document must be converted into the appropriate Asciidoc structure. The idea has been proposed and approved in the Ideation Phase. The proposal needs at least three (3) partner companies. Access the project’s online repository through the link provided by your GTM Optionally, check out the project repository or download the Executive Draft template and edit the AsciiDoc files directly. You must update the content of each chapter’s issue regardless of if you write in the AsciiDoc files directly or not! Fill in the default structure as follows (in the respective issues): Add a comprehensive 'Executive Summary' outlining the general idea of the proposed project Describe the reasons for this proposed project in the 'Motivation' section Define a set of (initial) use cases in the 'Use Cases' section (OPTIONAL) If you know of other standards this proposal relates to (ASAM or other), list them in the 'Relations to Other Standards or Organizations' section (OPTIONAL) Create an initial structure for the section 'Technical Content' and fill write as much project specific content as possible Discuss and optimize the document with your GTM Transfer the issues' content to the project’s AsciiDoc files. The GTM will support you with this task, if needed. Note that you do not need to render the document manually. The repository’s pipeline will create the required documents as artifacts automatically when the changes are committed and pushed to the trunk. See Access compiled artifacts to learn more about pipeline artifacts and how you can access them. The sections 'Project Resources' and 'Project Plan' will be filled out at a later stage and do not need to be edited in this draft. Responsible Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, {role-gtm} Step TL;DR Create the milestone plan Finalize content for submission Review content with proposal team Once the Proposal Workshop has taken place, the Proposal must be finalized. To do so, the Proposal Submitter (and all other involved writers) shall consider the following input for finalizing the project proposal: the existing Proposal draft meeting minutes of the Proposal Workshop relevant papers from concept projects (if any) The Submitter shall estimate the work efforts of the project and create a milestone plan. The duration of the plan shall not exceed 1.5 years. The Office then checks the proposal document for formal compliance and understandability. The proposal may contain a request for video conferencing support through the Office, if project group members originate from locations that would require long-distance (i.e. inter-continental) business trips to regularly participate at project meetings. The Submitter shall send out the proposal to all participants of the Proposal Workshop (if this occurred) for review before submitting it.","title":"Writing a Project Proposal","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"proposal_writing","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/getting-involved/proposal/proposal_writing.html","titles":[{"text":"The proposal document","hash":"_the_proposal_document","id":1},{"text":"How to contribute","hash":"_how_to_contribute","id":2},{"text":"Contributing through issues","hash":"_contributing_through_issues","id":3},{"text":"Contributing directly in AsciiDoc","hash":"_contributing_directly_in_asciidoc","id":4},{"text":"Transferring content to AsciiDoc","hash":"_transferring_content_to_asciidoc","id":5},{"text":"ASAM Editorial Guide","hash":"_asam_editorial_guide","id":6},{"text":"Writing the Proposal draft","hash":"_writing_the_proposal_draft","id":7},{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":8},{"text":"Result","hash":"_result","id":9},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":10},{"text":"How","hash":"_how","id":11},{"text":"Finalizing the Proposal","hash":"_finalizing_the_proposal","id":12}]},"399":{"id":399,"text":"Responsible {role-gtm} Involved Idea Giver, PROJECT PARTICIPANT Step TL;DR If completely new, create new subgroup with the proposed project name in Simulation and add members If not new, update the assigned members Fork the proposal template repository into this proposal subgroup as \" Proposal\" Inform members The basis for collaboration on Proposals at ASAM is GitLab.

If you want to learn more about the role of the Project Lead and its requirements, see Become Project Lead. Every project at ASAM needs a Project Lead. Consequently, a project may only move from Proposal phase to Standard Development phase if at least one project member has declared their candidacy for Project Lead. In most projects, the Idea Giver candidates for Project Lead, but this is not a requirement. The Project Lead is the main responsible for a project. They coordinate general activities, track the progression, decide on changes and the project direction, and are the main contact point for ASAM for that project. Often, the original Idea Giver or the Proposal Submitter also become the Project Lead, but this is not mandatory. A Project Lead is responsible both for the project’s content and its coordination. However, a project can decide to pass the organizational tasks on to a contracted project support (typically: a Service Provider) so that the Project Lead can focus on the content specification of the project.

PROJECT LEAD {role-gtm} Moderator must be neutral Allow all opinions. Hold back own opinion and proposals. Drive consensus building​ independent of own position. Accept the majority.​ Do not be judgmental. Let the group be judgmental: Yes ​ No \"That is excellent!\" → \"What do the others think about it? \"That is nonsense!\"​ → \"Does anyone has objections about that proposal?\" \"Let’s do this!\"​ → \"Should we do this?\" Moderator can voice his opinion and make own proposals Moderator must still remain neutral when managing the meeting. Give other opinions and proposals the same attention than yours.​ Moderator should send a second employee, who can openly represent the company’s opinion and proposals. Moderator must treat him like everyone else.​ Moderator must have technical competence in the standard’s subject matter In case the number of people who come to meetings drop A small decline in participation is normal and shall be accepted. If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here. Remind people about their man-day commitments, too. Keep the discussion focused on topic Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic But let the discussion go for a while Drive discussion towards results/decisions (not towards own/right results/decisions) Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution Do not let the discussion become repetitive In case discussions are very controversial Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has been said, carry out a vote. If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something \"might not work\" or​ \"could be too slow\"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known. If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g. propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone ​ carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​ propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort) Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority. Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority. In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down Ask a member or the Service Provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic. In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on. Moderator takes the initiative and drives the discussion forward with his own proposals. This is typically a situation, where the moderator can give up neutrality a bit without doing damage to the meeting culture. Give a summary of what has been said. Propose a conclusion/decision Obtain consensus of the conclusion/decision Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo Carry out a vote if needed Document key-points of the discussion (in a projected memo TODO)","title":"OpenX Calendar - Best Practices","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"calendar-best-practices","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Tools/calendar/calendar-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"General tips","hash":"_general_tips","id":1},{"text":"General meeting guidelines","hash":"_general_meeting_guidelines","id":2},{"text":"Whom to invite","hash":"_whom_to_invite","id":3},{"text":"Setting up a meeting","hash":"_setting_up_a_meeting","id":4},{"text":"Related topics","hash":"_related_topics","id":5},{"text":"Meeting moderation","hash":"_meeting_moderation","id":6},{"text":"Meeting moderation best practices","hash":"_meeting_moderation_best_practices","id":7},{"text":"Before a meeting","hash":"_before_a_meeting","id":8},{"text":"During a meeting","hash":"_during_a_meeting","id":9},{"text":"At the end of a meeting","hash":"_at_the_end_of_a_meeting","id":10}]},"409":{"id":409,"text":"{role-wg-lead} PROJECT LEAD All OpenX projects share a calendar under the email address of openx@asam.net.

If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label {isStatus:Duplicate} and assign the {role-wg-lead} The WG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to {requires:Clarification} and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue, applying the Branch Naming Conventions Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to {requires:ConceptualWork} to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch, adhering to the Commit Message Conventions Review implementation progress of issue with {role-wg-lead} and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Work Group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to {requires:CCBReview} If changes were developed in draft sections, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to {isStatus:WontBeFixed} and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Both tips reduce the chance for Merge Conflicts. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident. Mark passages which are not ready for viewing in the final output as draft (see Mark passages as draft) The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'. Click here for more information. If the review feedback requires further development work, the process restarts from the [Implementation] stage Tips Technical discussion happen in comments Change Control Board review Who CCB Steps If there are no unresolved comments or threads after two weeks, the CCB ends the review The Merge/Pull Request is assigned to the Service Provider for [Integration] Who SERVICE PROVIDER Steps The Service Provider changes the status label to {requires:DocumentationWork} The Service Provider refines the content in the Merge/Pull Request The content is adjusted to adhere to ASAM style and writing conventions General editorial rewrites to ensure homogeneity of content Questions on content should be addressed to the original issue assignee who will be responsible for ensuring a satisfactory resolution. In the case that questions lead to significant changes to the content, the MR is reopened for review on resolution. On completion of the integration: Set the status label of the Merge/Pull Request to {requires:CCBReview} Set to squash commits with fast-forward merging (default). Squash commit message MUST adhere to the Commit Message Conventions Who CCB Steps CCB performs a final review of the integrated content Is the original content still correctly represented? Are all guidelines & conventions maintained? Are all discussions resolved? Does it have a clear commit history that adheres to the Commit message conventions? If the review is not passed, return to [Integration] If the review is passed and the CCB can merge, the CCB merges the Merge/Pull Request back to the trunk The CCB removes the status label and closes the linked issue If the review is passed but the CCB may not merge, the CCB changes the status label to {requires:Merge} Tips Use a pull request for code reviews. Delete local and remote feature branches after merging. You can contribute to ASAM projects directly through issues. These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project. For more information, see Contributing through issues in the Compendium. Projects may get so big that issues are created and forgotten without ever being finished. To prevent unnecessary and obsolete issues bogging up the repository, ASAM employs a Ticket Triage workflow.

Visual Studio Code can be adapted to each project’s and the user’s needs. This is done by installing and using extensions. This section shows how to install a new extension from the marketplace. As an example, we will use the AsciiDoc extension. The AsciiDoc extension for VSCode allows for easy creation and supported editing of AsciiDoc or adoc files within VSCode. For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension. You can access this documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace. Access the extensions window through the VSCode menu bar → View → Extensions. Search for AsciiDoc (or use asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) & install it. The AsciiDoc extension will add the syntax the AsciiDoc interpreter to VSCode so you can use the preview feature and have syntax highlighting. Figure 1. AsciiDoc (id: asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) VSCode has a lot of very helpful extensions that can be downloaded and installed through the integrated marketplace. You can view the recommended list of extensions here. VSCode is already without extensions very powerful and user friendly. One thing that can make the VSCode experience even better are the extensions. There is a list of extensions we recommend that will make your life contributing to the ASAM standards way easier. Installing an extension is really easy, just enter the extension menu, search for the desired extension. Then, click on the Install button. The AsciiDoc extension will add the syntax the AsciiDoc interpreter to VSCode so you can use the preview feature and have syntax highlighting. Figure 2. AsciiDoc (id: asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) The Comment Anchor extension provides you with the ability of adding highlighted keywords to the raw text. Figure 3. Comment Anchors examples The extension also lets you search for all available anchors in the repository or current file and offers a jump-to option. Figure 4. Comment Anchors (id: exodiusstudios.comment-anchors) The Draw.io extension for Visual Studio Code allows for easy creation and assisted editing of drawio and other files supported by Draw.io within Visual Studio Code. For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension. You can access this documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace. Figure 5. Draw.io Integration (id: hediet.vscode-drawio) The Draw.io extension does not support remote custom libraries as of now. For this reason, it is recommended to create and make larger edits to drawio files through the web app. The Code Spell Checker extension provides you with the ability of spell checking in Visual Studio Code. Figure 6. Code Spell Checker example 1 Figure 7. Code Spell Checker example 2 Figure 8. Code Spell Checker example 3 The spell checker handles standard text as well as CamelCase. Figure 9.

The following sections describe this workflow in more detail. Workflow stages Figure 1. Workflow stages Each stage is described in more detail in the sections below. The role listed at the top of each section is the one responsible for it. Initial setup Analysis Implementation Review Integration Merge Who SUBGROUP LEAD Steps Create issues that map to the features in the project list Assign the issues to the correct Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label requires:Clarification to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label isStatus:Duplicate and assign the SUBGROUP LEAD The SG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to requires:Clarification and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, follow the steps as layed out in Contribution workflow Implement the topics of that issue Review implementation progress of issue with SUBGROUP LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Sub-group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete, request a review by the whole project The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'. Click here for more information. If the review feedback requires further development work, the process restarts from the Implementation stage Tips Technical discussion happen in comments Change Control Board review Who CCB Steps If there are no unresolved comments or threads after two weeks, the CCB ends the review The Merge/Pull Request is assigned to the Service Provider for Integration Who SERVICE PROVIDER Steps The Service Provider changes the status label to requires:DocumentationWork The Service Provider refines the content in the Merge/Pull Request The content is adjusted to adhere to ASAM style and writing conventions General editorial rewrites to ensure homogeneity of content Questions on content should be addressed to the original issue assignee who will be responsible for ensuring a satisfactory resolution. In the case that questions lead to significant changes to the content, the MR is reopened for review on resolution. On completion of the integration: Set the status label of the Merge/Pull Request to requires:CCBReview Set to squash commits with fast-forward merging (default). Who CCB Steps CCB performs a final review of the integrated content Is the original content still correctly represented? Are all guidelines & conventions maintained? Are all discussions resolved? Does it have a clear commit history? If the review is not passed, return to Integration If the review is passed and the CCB can merge, the CCB merges the Merge/Pull Request back to the trunk The CCB removes the status label and closes the linked issue If the review is passed but the CCB may not merge, the CCB changes the status label to requires:Merge Tips Use a pull request for code reviews.

Simulation ASAM IT infrastructure Remote Repositories provide an integrated working environment and text editor. With these, users can directly create and edit files without having to install tools like Git or Visual Studio Code. The choice of remote repository depends on the project. Most ASAM projects use ASAM’s GitLab instance. If you are unsure which type of remote repository your project is using, ask your ASAM Office Responsible (OR). ASAM recommends looking up specific questions on these platforms and their features in general on their respective online documentation.

Each Sharepoint’s start page acts as the main access webpage for the project team. Each project may design their pages differently. The following image shows an example. Every project at ASAM has its own Microsoft Sharepoint that uses the same base folder structure. It stores documents that are project related but not directly content for the project. Sharepoint also serves as a project’s landing page (webpage) for the group where news are shared, FAQs are hosted, and important links and files can be found. You can use Sharepoint online or synch it locally. ├───01_administrative................................// this is where all administrative topics are stored │ ├───controlling..................................// contains all topics related to the controlling part of the project │ ├───ASAM Participant_list.xlsx.....// contains all enrolled project members with their contact details and their Sub-group assignments │ └─── Proposal............// the project proposal as .docx or .pdf or .html │ ├───02_meetings......................................// contains folders with provided presentations and optional recordings of project meetings │ └───03_development...................................// may be used to share and exchange supporting material and other external content not directly relevant to the standard itself Each Sharepoint may also contain an archive containing information from previous project iterations. In ASAM projects, Sharepoint is used to exchange information in the team that is not a direct result or content of development. It consists of a landing page specific to the project and may be extended by the group as they see fit. In addition to the landing page and its webpage features (such as FAQs), the main aspect of Sharepoint is its documents storage. Sharepoint can be used to exchange files not directly used as project content (e.g. background information, studies, floor plans for meetings etc.). It also contains the approved project proposal as well as the current participants list. The Sharepoint also contains a current controlling overview for any involved external parties. Any content directly relevant to the project’s deliverables (such as images to be used in a standard) are not to be organized through Sharepoint. Instead, such information has to be entered through the project’s repository so that is subjected to the same version control as all the other content. The same is true for meeting notes, which are to be taken as repository issues. Each Sharepoint contains a list of all participants in the related project. This list is set up initially based on the signups during the Proposal phase. However, participation and assignments may change during development. It is the responsibility of the Project Lead to keep this document up to date on at least a monthly basis. They may delegate this task to another project member. When you join a project, make sure that your contact information in the project’s participant list is present, correct, and up-to-date.","title":"Project Sharepoint","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.1.0","name":"sharepoint","url":"/projectintroduction/1.1.0/tour_guide/sharepoint.html","titles":[{"text":"Project landing page","hash":"_project_landing_page","id":1},{"text":"Folder structure","hash":"_folder_structure","id":2},{"text":"What Sharepoint is used for","hash":"_what_sharepoint_is_used_for","id":3},{"text":"What Sharepoint is NOT used for","hash":"_what_sharepoint_is_not_used_for","id":4},{"text":"Participants list","hash":"_participants_list","id":5}]},"435":{"id":435,"text":"Congratulations!

With this, you do not need to install and configure software, programming languages etc: just download and use a pre-configured container that has all the relevant configuration already built in. From the docker homepage: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Figure 1. The Docker architecture For Asciidoc, docker can be used to run a pre-configured asciidoctor setup for creating html output locally. This removes the need to upload adoc files and use the build pipeline for every change you want to see. It also means you do not have to install and configure Asciidoctor first since this is already done in the pre-configured Docker image. If you do not have Docker installed, check out the Docker before continuing. If your project is currently missing the docker-compose.yml, see these compendium:How-Tos/setup_standard_docker_config.adoc on how to set it up. A project’s final specification document is created as HTML file. However, having to run it through the pipeline every time before being able to see the final result after having made changes is neither efficient nor friendly to the other Sub-group members. To render a project’s documentation without having to upload it, use Docker Compose with a correctly defined docker-compose.yml file.

These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project. It must be possible for every project member to contribute to and give feedback on the content of a Proposal document directly. For this purpose, all content discussions shall happen through issues in a project’s issue board. A clean issue contains the following things: active milestone assignee labels If your project is on ASAM GitLab, see the GitLab instructions for creating issues. If your project is on GitHub, see the GitHub instructions for creating issues. Every topic shall have its own issue. If a topic is too complex for a single issue, sub-issues shall be created. An issue with sub-issues shall only be closed if all its sub-issues have been closed. If an issue has a branch, the issue shall not be closed before the branch has been merged or closed. Issues shall be created using the provided issue templates in the repository. Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where. Figure 1. Creating an issue from a template The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently. Each issue and merge/pull request must apply labels as defined in labels.adoc. A project may also have project-specific labels in addition to the official ones, specified directly in the project group. The content of issues is discussed and resolved through comments and replies to previous comments. Content Comments Replies The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue. In the case of a feature or chapter description, it contains the current content of that chapter. It shall always be up-to-date and contain the latest discussed and approved version. In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic. In the latter case, the content shall only be updated to correct mistakes therein. A comment to an issue is a new topic that is independent from any previous comment. GitLab GitLab instructions for commenting GitHub GitHub instructions for commenting Before you add a new comment to an issue, make sure it is not a duplicate (i.e. the same or a similar comment already exists) and that it is not supposed to be a reply! Failure to do so will prevent efficient project progress. A reply is a comment created as a reply to a previous comment. In the issue, it is a child comment to the previous one and listed in relation to it. GitLab GitLab instructions for threads/replies GitHub GitHub instructions for communication If you want to reply to a previous comment, make sure to create a reply, not a new comment! An issues shall be closed once its discussion is resolved. Possible reasons: The questions of the issue have been answered The bug has been fixed and the fixes have been reviewed and merged The feature has been developed, reviewed, and merged It is best practice to close an issue immediately after one of the closing conditions has been met. Additionally, an issue may also be closed without resolution if it has become obsolete it is a duplicate (i.e. another issue deals with the same topic already) Closed issues can be reopened if they have become relevant again, there have been new developments directly impacting this specific issue, or the issue has been closed by accident and has not actually been finished yet.","title":"Contribute with issues","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.1.0","name":"contribute_with_issues","url":"/projectintroduction/1.1.0/tour_guide/contribution/contribute_with_issues.html","titles":[{"text":"Make discussions accessible","hash":"_make_discussions_accessible","id":1},{"text":"Gather topics in issues","hash":"_gather_topics_in_issues","id":2},{"text":"Sub-issues","hash":"_sub_issues","id":3},{"text":"Closing issues and sub-issues","hash":"_closing_issues_and_sub_issues","id":4},{"text":"Use issue templates","hash":"_use_issue_templates","id":5},{"text":"Label issues correctly","hash":"_label_issues_correctly","id":6},{"text":"Discuss issues","hash":"_discuss_issues","id":7},{"text":"Close issues","hash":"_close_issues","id":8},{"text":"Reopen issues","hash":"_reopen_issues","id":9}]},"444":{"id":444,"text":"Guide progress ASAM’s collaboration tools Setup for your development platform account Meeting types at ASAM Meeting guidelines How to participate in meetings The Project Sharepoint ASAM’s contribution workflow Contribute with issues How issues are implemented Typical tools for advanced users Simulation domain Classic domain Never work on the trunk directly — always work in separate branches! Projects in the Simulation domain use trunk-based repositories in either GitLab or GitHub. A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived (<2 weeks) and regularly merged back. These branches MAY be squashed and MUST be merged via fast-forward merge (enabled by default). Once an issue can be implemented, the issue’s assignee creates a branch with an associated Merge or Pull Request from the issue. Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to requires:ConceptualWork to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch Review implementation progress of issue with SUBGROUP LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Sub-group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to requires:CCBReview If changes were marked as draft, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to isStatus:WontBeFixed and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident.

The guidelines apply to every project level meeting (where the whole project is invited) and all Sub-group meetings (where the whole Sub-group is invited). These are considered official meetings in this context. Clarification or co-development calls as well as similar informal types of meetings do not have to follow these guidelines. They still may if they wish, of course. If you are hosting an official meeting, make sure to familiarize yourself with them ahead of time. An official meeting will not take place unless a minute taker is defined in advance! Project meetings are set up by the ASAM office, even when they are not the meeting host. All other meetings within a project (such as Sub-group meetings) have to be set up by the respective host. Every meeting has a host. This is the person who calls the meeting. The host has the following responsibilities: Define the minute taker. They can take that role themselves if they wish. If not, the assignee has to agree to this task first. Provide the agenda for the meeting Set up the meeting and send out the invites (exception: project meetings are set up by the ASAM office in coordination with the host) Moderate the meeting Ensure to stay within the defined timetable If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants (assignees) Ensure that minutes are taken and send out the link to them afterwards Follow up with assignees on assigned tasks after the meeting The minute taker is designated by the meeting host. This may be the host themselves. However, the host may not just appoint role to a project member without their consent. The order of responsibility regarding the taking of minutes is as follows: Host (since they usually do not need to travel) Service Provider Project Lead Office Responsible The minute taker has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Create the meeting notes document ahead of time Add the provided agenda to the meeting notes During the meeting Document the participants as well as missing meeting members Take notes during the meeting Document all assigned tasks with their assignees Add provided links and documents After the meeting Request missing documents and links from the responsible participants Update the notes with delivered updates (e.g. links to files) Finalize the notes once everything has been provided Inform the host in case of overdue tasks The host of the meeting is responsible for providing a meeting agenda ahead of time. The agenda must be shared in the invite to the meeting. The agenda also has to be included in the meeting notes. Each agenda must at least have the following contents: Antitrust Reminder scheduled votes for the meeting documentation of participants voting template agenda items The target audience depends on your meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR. The OpenX Calendar The list of project participants can be found in the project’s participant list. This list also contains information on the group or groups each participant is part of. Feel free to use whatever solution you or your company normally use. If your company does not provide you with a suitable solution, send the details to your ASAM representative and they will assist (either with Teams or Zoom). Meetings are the default way of taking project- or Sub-group-level polls. Their results have to be made available in the corresponding meeting notes. By default, polls are announced in the agenda (before the meeting takes place). However, if spontaneous topics arise, ad hoc polls can be held if all impacted participants are present. In case one or more crucial members for a topic’s ad hoc poll are missing, the poll has to be postponed and scheduled for the next meeting instead. A poll is only valid if at least 50% of registered active (sub-)group members cast their vote and the Issue Responsible (if defined) is present. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. A passive participant (someone not involved in the development directly) is neither considered for this threshold nor may they participate in any polls. To be eligible for casting a vote, a member has to have been present during the corresponding topic discussion/presentation. The only exception to this is voting for topics of static nature, such as meeting frequencies. All votes must be cast digitally and through an online tool (so both onsite and remote users can vote). ASAM recommends the use of \"Microsoft Forms\" in case of online voting. You can ask your ASAM Office Responsible for support on creating such a vote ahead of time. Do a quick vote first (e.g. show of hands). If it is unanimous, you can skip the formal process of voting. Make sure to document the result in either case, however. In a project-level meeting, each company has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all participating companies. It is recommended that if a company has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a company casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally), their vote is counted as abstention. In a Sub-group meeting, each participant has one vote. The barrier for a valid poll is, therefore, 50% of all Sub-group members. This is independent of company affiliation. Meeting notes (minutes) are to be taken in the project’s repository. The repository contains a template for meeting notes that shall be used. The designated minute taker is responsible for taking the notes. The notes must contain all important decisions (including cast votes). Additionally, the next scheduled meeting shall be listed here as well. Schedule regular meetings at least every 6-8 weeks Send a reminder to all assignees with open topics with enough time ahead of the next meeting Schedule remote meetings only for organizational issues Present results, particularly substantial changes in Sub-groups, to the whole project group regularly If you want to give a presentation in a project meeting, upload your presentation in the meeting’s \"presentations\" folder in your project’s Sharepoint ahead of time","title":"Meeting guidelines","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.1.0","name":"guidelines","url":"/projectintroduction/1.1.0/tour_guide/meetings/guidelines.html","titles":[{"text":"Roles in meetings","hash":"_roles_in_meetings","id":1},{"text":"Meeting host","hash":"_meeting_host","id":2},{"text":"Minute taker","hash":"_minute_taker","id":3},{"text":"Meeting agenda","hash":"_meeting_agenda","id":4},{"text":"Whom to invite","hash":"_whom_to_invite","id":5},{"text":"Setting up a meeting","hash":"_setting_up_a_meeting","id":6},{"text":"Polls and voting","hash":"_polls_and_voting","id":7},{"text":"Project-level voting","hash":"_project_level_voting","id":8},{"text":"Sub-group voting","hash":"_sub_group_voting","id":9},{"text":"Meeting notes","hash":"_meeting_notes","id":10},{"text":"Best practices","hash":"_best_practices","id":11}]},"446":{"id":446,"text":"Guide progress ASAM’s collaboration tools Setup for your development platform account Meeting types at ASAM Meeting guidelines How to participate in meetings The Project Sharepoint ASAM’s contribution workflow Contribute with issues How issues are implemented Typical tools for advanced users","title":"Participating in meetings","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.1.0","name":"participation","url":"/projectintroduction/1.1.0/tour_guide/meetings/participation.html","titles":[]},"447":{"id":447,"text":"Guide progress ASAM’s collaboration tools Setup for your development platform account Meeting types at ASAM Meeting guidelines How to participate in meetings The Project Sharepoint ASAM’s contribution workflow Contribute with issues How issues are implemented Typical tools for advanced users There are three different types of meetings: ASAM-level meetings Coordination within ASAM between multiple projects as well as the with the organization itself Project-level meetings Coordination for the whole project and general project discussions Sub-group meetings Coordination within a sub-group of a project Each project at ASAM is also part of an overarching project coordination. This coordination includes different monitoring and steering meetings. It is the Project Lead’s responsibility to represent their project in those meetings. Simulation domain projects are required to participate in the following external ASAM meetings: CGSim controlling meetings TSC controlling meetings Figure 1. Medium length development project example, including cycle details and external ASAM controlling meetings. The Coordination Group Simulation (CGSim) controlling meetings are the default reporting location for development projects. Here, each project presents their current status regularly (after every cycle). If a project is behind schedule or faces unpredicted problems and setbacks, or if the project’s scope needs to be altered significantly, the project status is escalated at the next TSC controlling meeting. The Project Lead discusses these topics with the project’s ASAM Office Responsible to decide whether they need to be escalated to the TSC and, if so, how. These are the top level controlling meetings at ASAM, where the TSC reviews all current projects. Here, projects can request more time as well as submit their deliverables for review and, ideally, approval for release. In case a project faces unforeseen problems and setbacks, these are addressed here as well after having been presented at a preceding CGSim controlling meeting. If you are interested, the ASAM Website provides some more information on the whole development process. Check out the Development Process page. If you have additional questions, don’t hesitate to contact your ASAM representative. A project-level meeting is declared as such when all enrolled project members are invited to participate. The most common examples for these meetings are the Kick-off Workshop the Development Cycle review the Retrospective If possible, project-level meetings are to be held face-to-face. If circumstances forbid this, online meetings are acceptable as well. ASAM recommends to hold a project-level meeting at least once a quarter. A full project meeting is used to hold project level votes, align across Sub-groups and evaluate the overall status with respect to the project plan. The group can decide to combine these with the Cycle Review meetings since most aspects of a project-level meeting coincides with those of a Cycle Review. However, if a Cycle takes longer than 3 months, ASAM recommends having a separate project-level meeting in between. Every sub-group will schedule their own meetings. Typically, these meetings happen more frequently than the larger project-level meetings. Here, the sub-groups discusses progress, setbacks, and current topics within their assignment and make related decisions.","title":"Meeting types","component":"projectintroduction","version":"1.1.0","name":"types","url":"/projectintroduction/1.1.0/tour_guide/meetings/types.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"ASAM-level meetings","hash":"_asam_level_meetings","id":2},{"text":"CGSim controlling meetings","hash":"_cgsim_controlling_meetings","id":3},{"text":"TSC controlling meetings","hash":"_tsc_controlling_meetings","id":4},{"text":"Information online","hash":"_information_online","id":5},{"text":"Project-level meetings","hash":"_project_level_meetings","id":6},{"text":"Sub-group meetings","hash":"_sub_group_meetings","id":7}]},"448":{"id":448,"text":"Unresolved include directive in modules/compendium/pages/Tools/calendar/calendar-best-practices.adoc - include::contributing:partial$_attributes.adoc[] {calendar-icon-page} All OpenX projects share a calendar under the email address of {openx-calendar-mail}.

Git can also interface directly with VSCode, making changing and updating files from within one tool an easy option. Git is installed locally. Git credentials (SSH) is configured For direct integration: VSCode is installed Git requires a multi-step installation. The following sections describe each part of this setup sequentially. If you are unsure if git is installed, you can check by entering the following in a shell window and confirming: git --version If a git version is returned, git is already installed on your system. If git is not installed, follow the instructions on how to install git After installation of Git, configure your user credentials that Git uses when checking in changed content from your PC to the ASAM GitLab. To make sure your commits match your name and email details, a one time configuration is necessary. Open a shell or terminal window Execute the following command and replace the entries \"FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME\" accordingly: git config --global user.name \"FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME\" Example 1. Setting git user name for Max Mustermann git config --global user.name Max Mustermann Next, execute the following command and replace the entry \"MY_NAME@example.com\" with your comany’s email: git config --global user.email \"MY_NAME@example.com\" Example 2. Setting email for Max Mustermann working at company git config --global user.email max.mustermann@company.com If no error is returned, the configuration step has been successful. To ensure you don’t have to enter your login details every time you want to interact with the repository, add an SSH key to your account. Generate an SSH key pair following the official instructions. Entering a passphrase is optional and leads to additional steps every time you connect to the remote, so it is not recommended. Add the generated SSH public key to your GitLab account by following these instructions. Verify that you can connect If you cannot click Next, make sure Visual Studio Code is already installed. Return to the previous step and continue again. Now, the Next button should be active. Make sure that the ssh-agent is running: Open a shell or terminal window Type the following command, hit Enter, and check the status: Get-Service ssh-agent If the status is \"Stopped\", type the following, hit Enter, and check the StartType. Get-Service ssh-agent | Select StartType If the StartType is \"Disabled\", activate the SSH Agent. See My SSH agent is deactivated. Continue here after your SSH agent has bee activated. Enter the following command and hit Enter Start-Service ssh-agent This requires administration rights. If you do not have these, request support from your IT department. Open a shell or terminal window with Administration rights Set the SSH Agent to start manually by typing the following command and hitting Enter: Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual This cannot be done in the Administration terminal window if your Admin account is not your user account! Otherwise, Windows will complain about unprotected private key files!

However, not all functions that ASAM requires for an efficient and partially automated content structuring are present by default. For this reason, an Antora extension and an Asciidoctor extension were created. This page collects all the features of this extension, such as the custom macros, and explains what they do and how to use them. Each macro also has a detailed instructions page with more details. For more information on how to write an Antora extension, see the official extension guide and check out the relevant package repositories, particularly their devdocs folders. The source repository of the ASAM extensions is https://code.asam.net/common/asam-antora-extensions. All following examples assume the extension is located under \"./antora_extensions\", where \".\" is the location of the \"site.yml\" file (the Antora playbook). Most extensions are not fully supported in partials, particularly those depending on Asciidoctor features like \"include\"! The following table describes general configuration on using the extension: Attribute Description Default Example id Defines an id by which the extension can be specifically called from the CLI. none id: asam-extension enabled De-/activates this extension by default. If deactivated, the extension must be explicitely called from the CLI. Only relevant in combination with id. true enabled: false require Describes the location of the extension. none require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js' Example 1. General configuration for ASAM Antora extensions in site.yml - id: asam-extensions require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js' The following sections describe features directly applied through the pipeline. These are features that typically are relevant to the whole site. They enact general rules or features, or they collect information about all content. Orphan pages Keyword-overview page Page numbering Sequential figure and table numbers ISO-2145 style section numbers Convert local to global page references The ASAM Antora extension finds all pages not listed in any nav.adoc and puts a warning in the console output. If configured, these pages can also automatically be listed under a separated navigation entry (e.g. \"orphans\") at the end of the Antora document. For more details, see Pipeline: Orphan pages. The ASAM Antora extension generates an overview page that lists all keywords used in the Antora pages. The location and the (virtual) filename can be configured in the site.yml (Antora playbook). For more details, see Pipeline: Keyword page. To see the result of the applied pipeline feature, see By default, Antora does not support sequential page numbering. However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters. In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages. Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages. To fulfill this requirement, the \"Page numbering\" extension features were implemented. These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two (\"== \") sections on each page). Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential figure and table numbers. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential numbering. Since Asciidoctor counts all images and tables only within each page, their caption numbers start at 1 on every new Antora page by default. In case of standards, these numbers must be sequential (and unique) within each standard, not each page. Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential section numbers and page titles. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential figure and table numbers. By default, section numbers in Asciidoctor have a trailing dot (\".\"). To be in line with ISO 2145, sections in standards have to be numbered without this trailing dot. The Antora extension, in combination with the 'sectnums_to_iso' extension for Asciidoctor, addresses this problem. For more details, see Pipeline: ISO-2145 style section and page numbering. Using Asciidoctor, it is typical to create one main file and include content from separate files. With this approach, each section or chapter can be managed separately while still compiling everything into a single final document. However, in Antora these sections or chapters stay separate in most cases since the idea is to be able to access them individually and independently. When working with documents originally intended for a single-file-inclusion strategy, local references that only work if other files are also included will not work for the individual pages in Antora. To circumvent this problem, the ASAM Antora extensions analyze all pages and try to find the source file of the reference. If the content is included in multiple pages, pages in the navigation structured are prioritized over unlisted pages. Note, however, that this approach has limitations and should only be used if switching to a more Antora-native approach is too difficult! For more details, see Pipeline: Local to global anchor replacement. related reference pages role_related autonav Add related::[] in an empty line and replace with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference. You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword. To negate a keyword, use an exclamation mark (!) in front of it.

You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword. To negate a keyword, use an exclamation mark (!) in front of it. For more details, see Macro: reference Add page::[] in an empty line and replace with a list of arguments, separated by \",\" (comma).

For more details, see Macro: pages Add role_related::[] in an empty line and replace with a list of role labels, separated by \",\" (comma), and with an (optional) list of limiting keywords, separated by \",\" (comma). For more details, see Macro: role_related This ONLY works in nav.adoc files, not in regular pages or partials! The macro must also always be used as a comment (similarly to the Asciidoctor macro \"tag\"). If the module has a main page, add //autonav::[] without parameters in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. If the module has no main page, add //autonav::[none] in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. The macro uses the following rules to determine the main page of a module: If there is a file named like the module on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"index.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"main.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else use the first page in the alphabetically sorted list. For more details, see Macro: autonav The source code can be found in the ASAM GitLab repository. To use the provided ASAM extensions in an ASAM project, add the extension repository git as submodule to your project.

In case project-specific guides are required, a project may request a specific branch for content on the Project Guide. If the request is accepted, the project’s branch name will be 'open-x', where 'x' is the name of the project. Example: project 'OpenNEWSTANDARD' → branch name: 'open-newstandard'. No tags may be created on any project-specific branch. If important changes happen on the main branch that should impact the project as well, these changes shall be cherry-picked. Likewise, if a project concludes, its content is reviewed and approved updates from it shall be cherry-picked onto the 'dev' branch (and later be merged onto the 'main' branch). Antora can take content from different repositories, branches, and/or tags, and combine them in one single generate. In case of the ASAM Project Guide, the generator takes a single content repository and uses its two main folders to generate its content. However, the generator selects only a single branch+version combination from the 'guide' folder. In contrast to that, it takes multiple branches and tags from the 'content' folder. The figure above illustrates the applied mapping: The latest tagged version (in the example: v1.2.1) on the main branch gets the reference name 'latest' automatically All other tagged versions on main are displayed with their tag name The latest commit on main is also used for the \"Editing the ASAM Project Guide\" component The latest commit on the dev branch is used as pre-release version named \"dev\" The latest commit on any open-x branch is used for the corresponding \"version\" of the Specific Project Guide component All content on the branches 'main' and 'dev' use the component asamprojectguide All project-specific branches shall use the component specificguides The following rules are applied using git information: tag with 'v..' → version: x.y.z branch == 'open-*' → version: open* branch == 'dev' → version: dev The following must be specified by the branch maintainer: prerelease for 'dev'-branch (set to true) component name for open* branches (set to specificguides) Branches are not added automatically in Antora. Every branch that the Guide officially supports has to be added in the site.yml. Tags, however, are applied automatically as long as they follow the specified syntax: v.., where , , and are numbers. Example: v1.0.0 To generate the Project Guide, two repositories are used: a generator repository and a content repository. This is displayed in the figure below. Figure 1. Involved repositories in the Project Guide generation The content repository contains, as the name suggests, the content of the Project Guide. The repository mainly consists of two folders, 'content' and 'guide'. 'content' This folder contains all the ASAM Project Guide content. This is where everything intended for project participants and interested ASAM members is located. The generator takes this folder and, depending on the git reference (tag or branch), labels its version automatically. Note that, according to the [Mapping In Antora], the component for project-specific branches has to be specificguides, whereas the standard Guide content is asamprojectguide. 'guide' This folder contains all instructions and information on how to edit and maintain the Project Guide itself, including this page. Only one version of it may ever be available: the latest commit on the branch main or on dev (main by default)!","title":"Project Guide versioning
