There are two types of standards: base standards and associated standards. Standards can consist of several parts. These parts are independent (e.g. technology references) and must each individually comply with the basic document structure for ASAM standards. A base standard defines the syntax, abstract models, and functionality for general use. A base standard is defined in a technology-independent form. It can use a problem-/task-related notation, e.g., UML for an object model, or any suitable description for protocols. Typically, a base standard is A Format description (data structure) or A Protocol definition or An API and has the following properties: Platform-independent Technology-independent Supplier-independent Does not contradict any other ASAM standard There are platform- and technology-specific mapping rules for each base standard. These are defined in a Technology Reference as independent parts of the base standard. A Format Description standard defines the syntax and semantics of a file format to exchange data. Currently, these standards are defined in XML, but older standards, such as ASAM MCD-2 MC (ASAP2), still use proprietary ASCII formats. There are also binary description standards, for example, to store measurement data efficiently. A Protocol Definition defines the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication. A communications protocol is a system of digital message formats and rules for exchanging the messages in or between computer systems. A protocol may have a formal description. A Technology Reference specifies the technology-dependent interpretation of the generic standard as mapping rules. If these mapping rules are complied with, the deliverables are technology-specific implementations of standards that are suitable for a specific implementation platform and native programming languages. These Technology References are typically available for base standards and companion standards. An associated standard always refers to a base standard. These are examples of associated standards: Application Area Companion Transport Layer Specification An Application Area Companion is an associated extension of a base standard for a specific type of device or a specific application area. A companion uses the syntax and the abstract models of the base standard. Companion standards describe models for application fields (application-specific information) and are technology-independent. A transport layer specification details, for example, how a generic protocol definition is to be interpreted using a concrete physical layer. The transport layer provides uniform access to the application-oriented layers, so that the application-oriented layers do not have to take the properties of the communication network into account. A \"set of standards\" is a special form comprising different elements in one standard. ASAM provides a template for creating an ASAM specification, including a description of use and illustrated by examples. The style sheet defines an identical look & feel for all ASAM standards. The main definitions are for the headers and footers, and for the cover page and directories. Rules for designing graphics, tables, source text, headings, etc. are included.","title":"Creation of standards","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"creation-of-standards","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/concepts/creation-of-standards.html","titles":[{"text":"Classification of standards","hash":"_classification_of_standards","id":1},{"text":"Base standard","hash":"_base_standard","id":2},{"text":"Format description","hash":"_format_description","id":3},{"text":"Protocol definition","hash":"_protocol_definition","id":4},{"text":"Technology reference","hash":"_technology_reference","id":5},{"text":"Associated standard","hash":"_associated_standard","id":6},{"text":"Application Area Companion","hash":"_application_area_companion","id":7},{"text":"Transport Layer Specification","hash":"_transport_layer_specification","id":8},{"text":"Set of standards","hash":"_set_of_standards","id":9},{"text":"Structure of standards","hash":"_structure_of_standards","id":10}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"Many newer projects at ASAM follow the concept of Documentation as Code (Doc-as-Code). This concept refers to using the same tools and methods for documentation (or standardization) as for writing (software) code. The main benefit of this concept is the separation of content and text in documents from its layout rules and publishing. As described in the introduction, the general concept is to use established tools and processes from software development and apply them in the creation of documents. At ASAM, the main aspects of this concept are: Writing documents in plain text markup Using repositories with version control systems Collaborating on projects through online repository platforms At ASAM, the central aspect of this concept is the usage of plain text documents with a semantic markup language in creating standards and other documents, particularly the free AsciiDoc format. Its main benefit is the separation of content from style and layout rules, making it possible to specify general layout settings in a separate set of files and instructions for consistency over multiple projects. Writers also get the benefit of being able to focus on content first, handing of the layouting to other people. Another benefit is that AsciiDoc files can be opened and edited with any type of text editor, making it a platform-agnostic format. Different people can write content independent of the operating system on their work devices or requiring specific software licenses. Finally, the content is decoupled from the target output, making it easy to generate different types of documentation from the same source files, such as single-file PDFs as well as multi-page online documentation in html. It is even possible to generate multiple types of output in the same process. AsciiDoc source file Rendered output Figure 1. ASAM Foreword section in AsciiDoc (source) Figure 2. The same Foreword section rendered by Asciidoctor and Antora in HTML (rich output) If you want to learn more about AsciiDoc and how to use its powers in writing technical documents, see the official AsciiDoc Language Documentation and the Asciidoctor Writers Guide. Specific ASAM writing styles and rules can be found in the Editorial Guide. Besides the separation of source text and publication files, using tool-supported document versioning is another main aspect in the Doc-as-Code. ASAM projects employing Doc-as-Code use the software Git for this purpose. It allows for working on different parts, features, or versions of a project separately whilst also providing the necessary features for merging all changes that were made on these different versions again later. As this works best with plain text documents, it goes extremely well together with the plain text markup approach to document writing explained above. Content is stored in so-called repositories that each consist of one or more branches. At ASAM, there usually is one main branch (called \"main\" or (outdated) \"master\") and possibly one or more feature branches. The central branch (also called the \"trunk\") acts as the agreed or released \"official\" state of the repository, whereas the feature branches contain the current development topics. Each feature branch targets a single aspect of development, for example the language specification. Once the development in a feature branch has advanced enough, it’s changes are merged back into the trunk. This is done through a so-called Merge Request (MR), sometimes called a Pull Request (PR) instead. Figure 3. Repository workflow and branching example. The strategy of having one main branch (trunk) and develop changes in separate branches is called trunk-based development and the quasi-standard of modern software development. These repositories also contain some files with information about the history and current state of the content. The repository information is updated and used by Git and usually needs not to be changed by users manually. If you want to learn more about Git itself, ASAM recommends online introductions and tutorials such as this one. Additionally, you can find more information on using Git and working with repositories at ASAM in the tooling section. Contributing at ASAM is easy: you only need a web browser! The work on standards, particularly at ASAM, is of collaborative nature: People from different companies companies join in a project to develope something together. The idea is to create something that will be adapted and used not just by a single company but a majority of the target industry. Online repository platforms like GitLab and GitHub support the collaboration by providing features for commenting and reviewing content changes as well as issue boards for creating and tracking topics. In addition to that, they also integrate the same versioning and repository aspects described in the section above. Using online collaboration platforms with repository support provide multiple benefits: They typically provide online editors for content, so users can choose to participate in projects without having to install software (besides any standard web browser) Merge Requests (Pull Requests) can be reviewed and commented on with a side-by-side preview in the browser (diff view) They act as central repository location for the project(s) that can be accessed from anywhere (provided the user has sufficient rights), so all involved people always have access to the latest submitted changes They enable central automation steps through CI/CD pipelines, for example automated writing rules checks on a document after it was updated Integrated issue boards for keeping track of tasks, found problems, discussion topics, etc. The figure below shows an example issue from a project where a topic discussion takes place. Figure 4. Example for a topic discussion through the GitLab issue board in a project ASAM currently supports projects on both its internal GitLab instance as well as on the public GitHub. Each project can decide independently which platform it will use. GitLab is the most commonly used platform right now at ASAM.

This part contains an introduction to central aspects relevant on many other pages in this Project Guide. Start here if you are new to ASAM to understand the concepts the development of standards at ASAM is based on. Concept Description Project types ASAM distinguishes multiple types of projects. Each project type is defined in the respective Proposal phase (see below) and specifies the expected outcome and requirements as well as restrictions for the project. Project phases A typical project goes through multiple phases at ASAM. Each phase has specific steps and events that must or can happen. Both the phases and the types are illustrated in a fictitious project’s lifecycle. Roles There are different roles for people working at or with ASAM. A person can have one or more roles, and most roles only apply within a given project. Documentation as Code The central concept throughout the Project Guide is the concept of Documentation-as-Code (or Doc-as-Code). It is explained in the context of ASAM standard development.

Not all projects must necessarily pass through all these phases. See the phase descriptions below for more details. If you want to learn how to participate in a certain phase, check out the ASAM’s project processes part for more information. Figure 1. The ASAM Project Phases Ideation Proposal Development Review Release Public Retirement Purpose To decide whether an idea for a project is promising. Required for Any project not directly based on a previous project. If someone has an idea for a new standard, it triggers the ideation phase for a new project. During this phase, the idea is evaluated and fleshed out a bit until it is either discarded (e.g. it is not feasible or a duplicate of sorts) or accepted. In case the idea is accepted, the project moves on to the Proposal phase. Additional information Ideation phase Purpose To define funding and participants for a project and decide whether to proceed. Required for Every project type. Whether a project idea was just accepted or an improvement or update on an existing standard was proposed, the project enters the Proposal Phase. During this phase, a Proposal document is generated, detailing the project’s targets, participants, the budget, timeline, and other project-related information. The Project Type is also specified during this phase. With this document, the ASAM TSC decides if the project may continue or not. If the go-ahead is given, the project continues on to the [Development phase]. Additional information Proposal phase Purpose To develop the project’s deliverables. Required for Every project type. This is the main phase of each project. During this phase, the project-type specific deliverables are developed by the project participants. In the beginning, the project team organizes a workshop to specify their modus operandi and set up all technical aspects of the project. This is followed by specifying, writing, and reviewing content internally until the document or documents are ready for a ASAM-internal or public review in the [Review phase]. Additional information Development phase Purpose To review the developed deliverables. Required for New Standard Major Version Update Before they are officially released, the created deliverables are to be reviewed. Depending on the project, these reviews may be available to ASAM members only, free for the public, or a mixture of both. Any problems that are identified during any of these reviews are then analyzed and categorized. Important fixes have to be made before the deliverables are released, whilst improvements beyond the initial scope or minute details may be put off for future iterations. Additional information Review phase Purpose To release the developed deliverables. Required for Every project type. After the deliverables have been developed and (optionally) successfully reviewed by the TSC, they are released to the public. The project has now concluded. Developed and updated standards, however, will receive and process feedback afterwards in the [Public phase]. Additional information Release phase Purpose To apply the standard in the industry and officially support it. Required for Standards. During this phase, the released standard is publicly available and officially supported. There is no active development on the standard itself. However, feedback from users may still be gathered in order to start a follow-up project down the line to improve the standard. In this case, a new Project Proposal would be created and the process started anew. If, however, the standard at some point becomes obsolete or deprecated, it enters its final phase: the [Retirement phase]. Purpose To retire an outdated or deprecated standard. Required for Standards. This phase is the final phase for every standard eventually. The standard has become obsolete and is retired. With this, it will no longer be supported and propagated by ASAM.","title":"Project phases","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"project_phases","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/concepts/project_phases.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"This section needs approval by TSC. ASAM developes its products and results in projects. Different result types require different approaches and conditions. For this reason, ASAM defines three project types, which further characterize the work to be done within the projects. They are: Concept Standard development Study Figure 1. ASAM project types overview A new project can be triggered by either a new idea, a previous Concept Paper, or a previously released Standard. The intended output of each project type is a document. For a Concept project, the output is a Concept Paper (which can be the basis for a follow-up project) For a Standard Development project, the output is the standard + optional supplemental documents For a Study project, the output is a Study Report that details the findings of the project. Note that a new concept project is usually not triggered by a previous one. Table 1. Summary Purpose Develop supplementary products supporting the application of ASAM standards Funding Limit 75% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase Description Concept projects have the purpose to prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards. They are typically chosen when the envisioned standard is complex and requires significant resources to even develop a sound and solid project proposal. Goal The goals of concept projects are to propose specific content for ASAM standards and/or to provide justification for the usefulness, practicability, and feasibility of the proposed content. Repository suffix Concept For more details, see Concept project in the Compendium. New standard Major version update Minor version update Revision Table 2. Summary Purpose Create a new standard. Version 1.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A new standard is developed from the outset. There is no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio, or the predecessor has been declared as 'deprecated'. A new ASAM standard can be a transfer from another organization or an extension of a standard from another standardization organization. Table 3. Summary Purpose Add major features Make significant changes to existing features Version X.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A major version development project introduces significant changes to the standard, e.g. the addition of a new major feature or significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor. Table 4. Summary Purpose Add minor features Make minor changes to existing feature Version ?.X.0 New Features yes Backward compatible yes Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase A minor version development project introduces changes to existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Table 5. Summary Purpose Correct errors Remove ambiguities Add clarifications Make editorial improvements Change/add examples Version ?.?.X New Features n.a Backward compatible yes Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase A revision version development project resolves technical issues of the standard, i.e. corrects errors, removes ambiguities, adds clarifications to existing descriptions, makes editorial improvements or changes examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. A new revision version of an ASAM standard is always backward-compatible. Description Standard development projects are the core of ASAM. In these, workgroup members define the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated). Goal The goal is to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. Repository suffix Standard All variants use the same repository suffix. For more details, see Standard Development project in the Compendium. Table 6.

Each of these roles has their own set of requirements, mandatory and/or optional tool, guidelines and how-tos, some of them shared between multiple roles. Figure 1. Overview over the most relevant roles in ASAM projects. It is possible to have more than one role at the same time. Some roles require you to \"enroll in a project\" first. You can learn more about this process on the page Signing up for projects. The following table contains a list of the most prominent roles at ASAM and a short description for each of them. Click on a role’s label to navigate directly to the role’s summary page. Table 1. List of roles Outside roles (1) Someone who has access to and possibly is an active user of any ASAM standard. Some standards require ASAM membership in order to access the documents, whilst other standards are available to anyone online. The role Standard User is not directly involved in the creation of a standard. However, a Standard User may take over other (active) roles in a project by enrolling in it. Note that project participation also requires ASAM membership! (2) An ASAM member outside the project that participates in the review of one or more documents. When a project’s deliverables are reviewed, ASAM members who were not involved in the project directly can participate in the Review phase by becoming a Reviewer and providing feedback. Project roles (3) An ASAM member active in an ASAM project. Each project consists of multiple Project Participants who directly contribute to the project’s development. Most participants typically enroll during the Proposal phase, but it also possible to already participate during the Ideation phase. Typically, Project Participants work in one or more so-called Working Groups, each focussing on a specific aspect of the project. (4) The Project Participant responsible for the project and leading the general project activities. Every project needs one elected Project Lead who takes responsibility for it. The Project Lead is elected at the beginning of the Development phase. Any Project Participant can send in their candidacy during the Proposal phase. (5) A Project Participant leading the activities of a Working Group. Many projects divide up their activities into so-called Working Groups which focus on specific aspects of a project. Each of these groups may be led by a Working Group Lead. Supporting roles (6) ASAM contact of the project. A GTM is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project. (7) Editor and writing support. A Technical Writer supports the creation of documents. They ensure ASAM’s Editorial Guide is applied and the document is formalized. (8) Committee at ASAM reviewing a project’s state. The TSC is responsible for approving or rejecting budgets, projects and proposals as well as releases of project results, such as standards or concept papers.

With these, users can directly create and edit files without having to install tools like Git or Visual Studio Code. The choice of remote repository depends on the project. Most ASAM projects use ASAM’s GitLab instance. Alternatively, ASAM also supports projects on GitHub. If you are unsure which type of remote repository your project is using, ask your ASAM Global Technology Manager (GTM).

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users cannot commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in development or feature branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another feature branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Users MAY branch off the trunk for more focused development work. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label {requires:Clarification} to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label {isStatus:Duplicate} and assign the WG LEAD The WG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to {requires:Clarification} and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue, applying the Branch Naming Conventions Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to {requires:ConceptualWork} to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch, adhering to the Commit Message Conventions Review implementation progress of issue with WG LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Work Group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to {requires:CCBReview} If changes were developed in draft sections, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to {isStatus:WontBeFixed} and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Both tips reduce the chance for Merge Conflicts. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident. Mark passages which are not ready for viewing in the final output as draft (see Mark passages as draft) The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'.

In the case that questions lead to significant changes to the content, the MR is reopened for review on resolution. On completion of the integration: Set the status label of the Merge/Pull Request to {requires:CCBReview} Set to squash commits with fast-forward merging (default). Squash commit message MUST adhere to the Commit Message Conventions Who CCB Steps CCB performs a final review of the integrated content Is the original content still correctly represented? Are all guidelines & conventions maintained? Are all discussions resolved? Does it have a clear commit history that adheres to the Commit message conventions? If the review is not passed, return to [Integration] If the review is passed and the CCB can merge, the CCB merges the Merge/Pull Request back to the trunk The CCB removes the status label and closes the linked issue If the review is passed but the CCB may not merge, the CCB changes the status label to {requires:Merge} Tips Use a pull request for code reviews. Delete local and remote feature branches after merging. You can contribute to ASAM projects directly through issues. These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project. For more information, see Contributing through issues in the Compendium.

Signing up To participate in a Standard Development project, you must first enroll for the project and commit to it. Project commitment has to be announced in the Proposal Phase and is specified explicitly in the Proposal Document. Click the icon to learn about how to join a project and take over specific roles. Development If a proposal is accepted, the project enters the development phase. This is where the content and specifications of a standard and its (optional) supplemental documents are created, refined, and discussed. Click the icon to learn about how to participate in developing a standard at ASAM. Note that you must sign up first in order to join a project. Review Before any project’s deliverables are released, they are reviewed at ASAM first. This happens during the Review phase. Release Once a project has passed its Review phase, it enters the Release phase. Here, the TSC makes a final review and decides whether the deliverables can be released. If the project is released and it was a Standard Development project, it now enters its Public phase.","title":"ASAM’s project processes","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"main","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/getting-involved/main.html","titles":[{"text":"Phases overview","hash":"_phases_overview","id":1}]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"Involved roles Idea Giver — PROJECT PARTICIPANT — GTM — TSC MEMBER — ASAM Member Purpose To define funding and participants for a project and decide whether to proceed.

This document is submitted to the ASAM Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for approval. On approval, the next project phase (the Development Phase) can begin. Figure 1. The Proposal phase timeline In this phase, the proposed idea is further analyzed. In the Proposal document, central requirements are formulated, the expected effort is quantified, and the timeline is specified. In addition to that interested parties can sign up during this phase for project participation, the proposal is released to attract more attention as well as for transparency. The Proposal document is then submitted and presented to the TSC for approval. Submittal must occur at least two (2) weeks prior to the TSC meeting.

The Release Phase (simplified) TODO The Release phase consists of the following steps, which are explained in detail in their own sections: Candidate release Release candidate review Release decision Publication preparation Publication Purpose To decide upon technical readiness of the standard and submit the deliverables to the TSC. Responsible PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT, WG LEAD The project group prepares a release candidate and agrees per formal voting to submit the candidate to the TSC for release decision. Each company has one vote. The release candidate is accepted by absolute two-thirds majority. The group’s decision is documented in the meeting minutes. The Project Leader submits the following deliverables to ASAM: the standard with all supplemental documents, files and examples that constitute the deliverables to members. sources required to generate the deliverables, including written instructions how to generate them. revision history documentation (not needed for version 1.0.0). new release presentation. Sources are those digital work products, which can be modified or edited with standard tools such as text editors, image processors or modeling tools, and which are the input for generators that produce the final deliverables. Purpose To review the deliverables, to clarify open questions, and to come to an individual conclusion about the release-worthiness of the release candidate. Responsible TSC MEMBER Involved GTM The TSC members review the release with special focus on the changes. They shall clarify open question with the Project Leader prior to the TSC meeting. TSC members shall make up their mind whether the release candidate is ready for publication. The minimum review period for release candidates is four weeks. Purpose To approve or reject the release candidate. Responsible TSC MEMBER Involved PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT, WG LEAD Decisions on release candidates are put on the agenda of the next available TSC meeting. Release candidate decisions are handled during the meeting via a three-step process: Project leader presents the release candidate to the TSC members. TSC members are given the opportunity to ask questions. TSC members discuss the proposal (without Project Leader’s presence) and then proceed with casting their votes on the release. The TSC does not modify the content of the release candidate. If this is deemed to be necessary, then the release shall be rejected. The voting is carried out in accordance with the TSC voting rules. The Board Representative for the TSC has to confirm the TSC decision. The TSC may add requirements for rework of the release candidate and make the release contingent upon the completion of the required rework. The Office shall check the reworked release candidate submission. If the required rework has been implemented as defined by the TSC, then the release is effective and the release process continues. Purpose To prepare all marketing and distribution activities for the new standard release. Responsible GTM Involved PROJECT LEAD, PROJECT PARTICIPANT, WG LEAD The Office prepares new and updates existing marketing and training material for the new release. The Project Leader shall support this activity by contributing technical content and reviewing the new or updated marketing and training material, upon request. The publication of a new standard shall occur within 5 weeks after the effective release. The publication of a new version of an existing standard shall occur within 3 weeks after the effective release decision. Purpose To go live with the released standard. Responsible GTM The Office carries out all planed publication activities. As a minimum, the Office undertakes the following publication measures: The standard can be sold or published freely and is downloadable from the ASAM website. The release is announced via newsletter.

The goal is to increase the overall quality and acceptance of the standard prior to its release. Figure 1. The Review phase Purpose To create a preliminary version of the standard for carrying out a public review. Responsible Project group Involved none The draft standard shall be feature-complete, i.e. the specification or revision of all features of the standard has been finished. The project group members determine, whether the standard is ready for public review. The Project Leader is responsible for delivering the draft document(s) in a format, which is usable in the ASAM IT-infrastructure for document reviews.

Public reviews are mandatory for new standards and major versions of existing standards. The project group releases a draft of the standard, which is feature-complete and has undergone an internal review. Purpose To obtain technical review feedback from members. Responsible Office Involved Members, project group The Office publishes the start of the public review process via newsletter and ASAM website, and provides additional information, such as a brief description of the changes in the standard, review process steps and the review deadline. The Office provides an IT-solution for carrying out the public draft review. The Office provides technical support for reviewers and ensures that review feedback is accessible to the project group members in a timely manner. In general, every ASAM member can download the draft standard and participate in the review. The Office may restrict the group of reviewers in agreement with the project group members or as per TSC decision. Members of the project group are available to answer technical questions from reviewers. Reviewers shall not submit new use-cases, features or requirements as part of their review feedback. The Office asks the reviewers to submit such requests via the regular ASAM CR system. The minimum review period for a new standard is 8 weeks and shall not exceed 16 weeks. The minimum review period for a major version is 6 weeks and shall not exceed 12 weeks. The ASAM office publishes the draft and provides an IT environment in which members can provide their comments. Members are given a minimum period of six weeks for the review (eight weeks for a new standard). Purpose To end the public review and have all feedback ready for the next process step. Responsible Office Involved none The Office terminates the public draft review process by: removing the draft standard download from the ASAM website. closing the IT-solution to accept further review feedback. Once the review period is over, the ASAM office removes the draft standard from public access and makes the review comments available to the project group. Purpose To review and decide upon the reviewers' feedback and to incorporate corresponding changes to the draft standard. Responsible Project group Involved Members The project group has the obligation to review each review feedback and make a decision on how to further work on it. The decision includes as a minimum the status \"accepted\", \"rejected\" or \"deferred\". The decision must be documented. Accepted feedback shall be implemented. The project group has full authority how to implement the reviewers' feedback into the standard. They can implement changes as proposed by the reviewer, or decide for a different implementation. If a reviewer’s feedback is actually out-of-scope, since it contains a request to consider a new use-case, feature or requirement, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the ASAM CR-system with status \"new\". ASAM has the obligation to inform reviewers about the status of their review feedback, upon their request. The project group members have the obligation to review each comment and make a decision. The project group has full authority to decide, how to handle a comment, e.g. to accept, modify, defer or reject comments, and to make corresponding changes to the standard at their own discretion.

Sections may also have a tag if a link to the section is needed. Note: If you cannot come up with a document-wide unique id, just add [#tag-uid]. This triggers a pipeline warning and the technical writer can help you. Examples: [#top-uid] [#fig-uid] [#tab-uid] [#code-uid] [#sec-uid] You can generate a UUID using a generator like https://www.uuidgenerator.net/. Text sections (paragraphs or blocks of text) in the documentation of a standard are considered normative. If some text sections should be considered as non-normative and only descriptive (for example, background information or examples), mark this sections deliberately as non-normative. Non-normative sections shall be marked with the user-defined asciidoc role non-normative. Put the role attribute [.non-normative] in front of single paragraphs or blocks to mark them as non-normative. Inside a normative section use [.non-normative]## to mark single text passages as non-normative. Example for normative and non-normative sections This is a normative paragraph. [.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph. ==== This is a normative block. ==== [.non-normative] ==== This is a descriptive block. ==== This is another normative paragraph. This sentence is normative. [.non-normative]#This sentence is non-normative.# This sentence is normative again. Roles can be combined using the following syntax: [..]. Example with multiple roles [.important.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph that is also marked with the important-role. Id and role attributes can be combined. Use the long notation for easier reading: [id=, role=]. Example with role and id combined [id=top-doc-unique-id, role=non-normative] = Document title This is a descriptive, non-normative document. The actual format and style of non-normative sections depends on the entry in the CSS style sheet file that is used for rendering the text and is not coded in the adoc-file itself. Example of a CSS entry for non-normative text .non-normative { font-style: italic; color: darkgreen; background: gold } Lists are a great way to present lots of similar information in a compact form. Use the same word/sentence structure for all list items. Use numbered lists (Asciidoc '.') for steps that require a specific order. Use bullet points (Asciidoc '*') for enumerations and elements that do not require a specific order. A numbered list example . First step . Second step . Third step First step Second step Third step Table 13. Bullet point list example 'ingredients' No Yes first 2 apples, then one banana. And you need an orange too! two apples one banana one orange Figures, like pictures or drawings, may be used to illustrate complex facts. Preferred format: .svg Figures are stored in a subfolder named images located inside the chapter folder. Each figure shall have: a tag a caption the link to the picture an alternative text [#fig-uuid] .This is the caption of the figure image::logo.png[an alternative text] Figure 1. This is the caption of the figure Use tables if you have to present a huge amount of similar data in a very compressed form. A table shall have: a tag a caption [#tab-uuid] .This is the caption of the table |=== |cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3 |cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3 |cell 3_1 | cell 3_2 | cell 3_3 |=== Table 14. This is the caption of the table cell 1_1 cell 1_2 cell 1_3 cell 2_1 cell 2_2 cell 2_3 cell 3_1 cell 3_2 cell 3_3 Sometimes you may need to display a character that is reserved for adoc-formatting. Here is how to do it. Underscore (_) Use _ to display an underscore. Pound sign (#) Use # to display a pound sign. Protected space ( ) Use {nbsp} to define a space character is not used for automatic line breaks. This is especially useful for value-unit-pairs like 5{nbsp}m/s (5 m/s) to ensure that value and unit are always in the same line of text. Consider one of the following possibilities if you want to add source code examples to an adoc topic. You may use small bits of code as an inline literal directly inside your text. You may add source code as a fragment from a source code file by reference. You may copy and paste source code directly as a snippet into the adoc topic. For very small bits of code using inline literals is the most convenient way to add source code examples. This type of including source code is especially useful if you want to highlight single code elements like methods or class names. Enclose the source code in a pair of pluses surrounded by a pair of backticks, like this: Call the `+source_example_func()+` for the result. The previous line looks like this as adoc output: Call the source_example_func() for the result. You can add source code as a fragment from a source code file if you would like to reference to the source code within the source code file. There are several advantages of using fragments: You do not need to copy the source code into the documentation. You are referencing to the single point of truth, which is the source code file. If you apply changes to the source code file, these changes are automatically applied to your documentation. Follow these steps to add source code fragments to your documentation: Add source comment tags at the beginning and the end of the part of code you want to use in your code block. Use this tag to include the fragment into the adoc documentation. The example in the following subchapters uses the tag exampleInclude to add a code fragment. Tags for the inclusion of source code from a source code file [...] // tag::exampleInclude[] (1) (2) function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor /examplecode.js[tags=exampleInclude] (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block You can reference this anchor using xref:asamprojectguide:compendium:Guidelines/asciidoc-include_code.adoc#code-example-code-block-tag[Include code blocks] 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Directly include the source code within the source code file with a tag marking fragment. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. For more information see the Asciidoctor reference. This is how the reference looks like inside the adoc file: ASAM example code block included by tags function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block.

For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Insert the code block. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. This is how the correctly configured snippet looks like in the adoc file: ASAM example code block included in an asciidoc file Use [source, osc2] as a source block identifier for fragments and snippets (see example) to define the language type as 'osc2'. This enables future automatic syntax highlighting. The project uses the adoc attribute draft to steer the review process. This FAQ helps you to manage the review and attribute handling. Q1 What is this draft-attribute for? New content on the trunk has to be marked with the ifdef::draft[] - endif::draft[] 'feature flag' mechanism. New content in this case means content in adoc files that is not already reviewed and agreed on, like newly merged text from a development branch. A typical adoc topic looks like this: [#top-an-example-topic] = Topic heading ifdef::draft[] Some content that is new or still needs to be reviewed and agreed on. endif::draft[] Some other content that is already reviewed and ready for being part of the standard documentation. When a review is started, a WG-Lead or a member of the CCB removes the draft-mechanism for the part that has to be reviewed in the review merge request. Q2 I cannot see my content in the preview. What is wrong?:: You may experience an empty preview in your editor when editing files that contain the mechanism. + This is actually a good sign. The preview is working correctly and hides all parts marked as draft. + To make the parts visible again, you have to set the attribute draft for your preview window. In the Asciidoc extension settings go to Preview:Attributes - Edit in settings.json. In the settings.json add the draft attribute: \"asciidoc.preview.attributes\": { \"draft\": \"\" } Save settings.json Go to Settings on the right hand side of the preview Go to the Preview settings tab Add an Asciidoctor Attribute by double-clicking an empty attribute line Add attribute draft with value true Save the settings (small button on the lower left of the tab!) Reload the preview Other tools should have similar settings. The preview in Gitlab intentionally shows the release version of the files, meaning that the parts marked as draft are hidden. You can easily switch off the preview and view the source content by clicking on the display source-icon on top of the file window: Figure 2. How to switch to source-view in Gitlab The icon next to it switches back to the preview. Q3 My preview looks fine. Why do I get feedback that something is not formatted correctly?:: Please note that all the previews described in this chapter are just for your convenience. The only reliable documents for reviews are the html-artifacts generated by the CI-pipeline! These artifacts are linked at the beginning of review merge requests. You can also download the artifacts directly from the pipeline result page. For a short introduction to Asciidoc, see the https://code.asam.net/simulation/resources/-/blob/master/asciidoc_tutorial/asciidoc_tutorial.adoc. The adoc-templates can be found here. For a guide on how to format code examples see the https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/blob/master/Documentation/etc/guides/coding_style_guide.adoc. Topics for entities of the domain model can be automatically created if the UML diagrams contain specially formatted comments. See the https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/blob/master/Documentation/etc/guides/plantuml_documentation_guide.adoc for more details. More information about the workflow and review process can be found in the Project Wiki.

The content of this page is intended to provide a quick overview over the most used features of AsciiDoc. Main advantages of using AsciiDoc Can be edited in any text editor or using the remote repository’s Web IDE Focus on content, not on formatting! Versionable and diffable – i.e. we can tell who did what, when, and where! In the end, we can deliver an interactive html instead of a static pdf If you want to learn more about AsciiDoc, see the following links: Quick reference User manual Besides the general syntax, ASAM standards follow specific ASAM guidelines for AsciiDoc. These are listed below. For most cases, Draw.io shall be used. It’s a possibility to generate graphics with a powerful tool that can be included directly, without a intermediate image format. See DrawIO for usage. Im some cases, PlantUMl is used to model the relationships. See PlantUML for usage.

The addition of \"^\" at the end of the link name does the same in a shorthand version. For example: AsciiDoc Result image:logo.png[alt=A button titled ASAM Home,link=https://asam.net,window=_blank] You might want to draw attention to certain statements by creating notes or tips - so-called admonitions. Use each of these sparingly. You don’t want to create pages that are full of notes and tips. They become less meaningful if you do. Here’s what each of these looks like when the AsciiDoc content is turned into HTML: This is a note. It includes extra info that a reader might need to know. Here’s a tip. A tip provides useful information that can help a user do something or understand something. This is important information that the reader must be aware of so they don’t do something that they shouldn’t. A caution advises the reader to act carefully. Use this in rare circumstances. And this is a warning that informs of danger or harm. This one should be used very rarely, as well. If you’re authoring new content, you’ll want to review this section for some nitty-gritty details. If you’re explaining how to perform a task, you might include introductory information before you get to the steps. And you might need to say what to do after completing the steps. If you do, it’s best to organize that information using headers, which enables scanning. Use the following headings as needed: AsciiDoc Result .What you'll need _The information the user needs to complete the task._ .About this task _Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task._ .Steps _The individual steps to complete the task._ .What's next? _What the user should do next._ What you’ll need The information the user needs to complete the task. About this task Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task. Steps The individual steps to complete the task. What’s next? What the user should do next. Each of these should include a . right before the text, like so: .What you'll need .About this task .Steps .What's next? This syntax applies bold text in a larger font. This section shows how to include code blocks in an ASAM standard. In the standard case, a fragment direcly from a source code file is included, to not have duplicated code in the document. This is shown in chapter [Code as fragment from source code file]. In some cases, e.g. examples, it is also possible to direcly include code in the documentation. This is shown in chapter Code as snippet in document.

Moderator must treat him like everyone else.​ Moderator must have technical competence in the standard’s subject matter In case the number of people who come to meetings drop A small decline in participation is normal and shall be accepted. If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here. Remind people about their man-day commitments, too. Keep the discussion focused on topic Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic But let the discussion go for a while Drive discussion towards results/decisions (not towards own/right results/decisions) Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution Do not let the discussion become repetitive In case discussions are very controversial Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has been said, carry out a vote. If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something \"might not work\" or​ \"could be too slow\"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known. If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g. propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone ​ carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​ propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort) Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority. Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority. In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down Ask a member or the Service Provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic. In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on. Moderator takes the initiative and drives the discussion forward with his own proposals. This is typically a situation, where the moderator can give up neutrality a bit without doing damage to the meeting culture. Give a summary of what has been said.

A standard package consists of at least one base standard. Other deliverable items, as listed on this page, are optional. Base standard A base standard contains all fundamental specifications such as abstract object models, syntax definitions and functional behavior descriptions. It uses a problem- or task-oriented notation, such as UML or BNF. A base standard is technology- and implementation-independent. Each ASAM standard consists of one base standard document. Some base standards at ASAM are split-up into two documents, which is the Reference Guide, which contains all formal specifications of the standard in a reference-book style, and the User’s Guide, which further specifies the application of the standard. All other standard documents within a standard package are associated to the base standard, and are of one of the following types: Companion standard The notion of companion standard is typically used for application- or device-specific extensions of a base standard. Technology reference Technology references map the abstract specifications of the base standard to specific technologies, e.g. programming langages or data-base implementations. Transport Layer Specification Transport layer specifications are similar to technology references, as they also provide a technology mapping. The notion of transport layer specification is used in the area of communication technologies. They provide a mapping of the base standard to specific protocol- or bus-technologies. The transport layer abstracts access of higher application layers to the lower layers of the communication system. Model files Model files typically contain the object model of the standard. A typical example of a model file in ASAM standards are UML models created with the tool \"Enterprise Architect\" (.ea). Schema files Schema files define the formal structure and syntax of text files. They are used for automated schema validation. Typical examples of schema files are XML definition files (.xsd) or Google protocol buffers definition files (.proto). Interface definition files Interface definition files define programmatic interfaces, such as APIs (Application Programming Interface). They are used for automatic code generation of the standardized interface for specific programming languages. A typical example of an interface definition file is the Interface Description Language file (.idl). Example files Example files demonstrate a typical and standard-compliant implementation of the standard.","title":"ASAM Deliverables","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"deliverables","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Guidelines/deliverables.html","titles":[{"text":"Standard documents","hash":"_standard_documents","id":1},{"text":"Other files","hash":"_other_files","id":2}]},"71":{"id":71,"text":"This Project Guide uses a variation of BPMN 2.0 diagrams to describe the ASAM Project Phases.

The Workshop is created using the provided (4a) Ideation Workshop gameplan. 5 Whether the idea is a new standard or not, the Idea Giver has to raise enough interest to gather the required amount of participants for the Proposal phase, which is at least 3. He keeps the ASAM Office informed about the status, and the ASAM Office may support by bringing the Idea Giver in contact with potentially interested parties at ASAM. 6 Once the requirements for entering the next phase have been fulfilled, the project may enter the Proposal phase. The details of each step of a phase are explained on separate child pages under the page containing the full diagram. In the example above, one child page would cover the activity of how to propose an idea, another page would cover the ideation workshop, and a final page would cover tips on how to find participants for a Project Proposal. Disregarding the idea is not depicted explicitly. This can happen between most steps and, therefore, is kept out of the \"default way\" for clarity’s sake. The same is true for all BPMN-style diagrams throughout this Guide. To reduce the size of the diagrams, some changes compared to the original BPMN language were implemented: Loop returns may lead to an action directly rather than a loop connection point Legend for BPMN-style diagrams in Project Guide contains the legend applicable to all BPMN-style diagrams throughout the Project Guide.

Use quotation marks (\") or acute accents (´) instead. A standard adoc-documentation of an element. The appears as a comment in a value/comment-table. This type is useful to describe enum values and other elements without a special adoc-documentation tag.

Put the followed by a colon (without space), followed by a space, followed by the documentation . The following keywords are supported: instantiable Yes for normal entities, no for abstract entities. parent You may add a parent manually here. Parents are also automatically deduced from the uml file. description A description of the entity. controlled_states Action-specific information about controlled states. action_ending Action-specific information about when exactly an action ends. action_actors Action-specific information about which actors use the action. include Path to an adoc-fragment. If found, this fragment is added at the end of the description text before the basic information table. Use this option for more sophisitcated text formatting with paragraphs, lists and pictures.

Fragment with detailed description, like description and parameters. Example 5. Modifier comments class and_another_class { modify_xy() /'adoc-modifier ./path/to/fragment/thing_modify_xy.adoc '/ } Follow these steps to add documentation: Add adoc-comments to plantuml files. Commit and push plantuml files to gitlab. Make sure to adhere to the Commit message conventions. The pipeline then runs the script and adoc fragments are created automatically. If you want to exclude a uml-file from being analyzed, insert /'adoc-fileignore'/ at the beginning of the uml-file. Example 6. Exculding files @startuml foo /'adoc-fileignore'/ class bar { ... } @enduml If you want to check the content of the created fragments, you can download them as a pipeline artifact.

Creating an issue from a template The name of the issue shall correspond to the respective section. Figure 2. Topic issue for a proposal’s Executive Summary The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently. Each issue and merge/pull request must apply labels as defined in Issue and merge request labels. A project may also have project-specific labels in addition to the official ones, specified directly in the project group. The Content of issues is discussed and resolved through comments and replies to previous comments. The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue. In the case of a feature or chapter description, it contains the current content of that chapter. It shall always be up-to-date and contain the latest discussed and approved version. In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic. In the latter case, the content shall only be updated to correct mistakes therein.

Additionally, an issue may also be closed without resolution if it has become obsolete it is a duplicate (i.e. another issue deals with the same topic already) it has not been worked on for a long period of time (see The issue triage) ASAM has defined a process for closing outdated issues. This is called the \"Issue Triage\" or \"Ticket Triage\". See Ticket triage for more details.

If a project wants to use additional custom labels for extra filter options, each label must be documented in the project documentation and be accessible to each project member. All ASAM projects have their individual work packages clustered into groups or categories. These labels are defined individually for each project and should be used to categorize issues. An issue can have multiple Group and Work Package labels provided that it is relevant to more than one of these. ASAM suggest the following naming schema for group/category labels: Suggested workgroup label schema 'isWorkgroup':'Workgroup' Rules Remove spaces (\"Domain Model\" instead of \"DomainModel\") Example An issue label for the group Domain Model (DomainModel) would be 'isWorkgroup:DomainModel' This part contains all labels specific to the Proposal phase. Note that these come with the template repository and typically need not be added manually. Each issue targeting the Proposal document shall be assigned: Label Description isPhase:Proposal Denotes that this issue is relevant for the Proposal document. Milestones specify target dates and development phases for topics. Projects organize their issues by assigning them to milestones created separately. Each project has their own set of milestones that correspond to the milestone planning for the current project phase.

For example, if user A deletes a section in their copy and user B adds a new paragraph to it instead, the merging tool does not know whether to keep the section and add the changes made by user B or to delete it like user A did. One way of avoiding merge conflicts is to keep the TTL (time to live) of branches short. ASAM recommends a TTL of ⇐ 2 weeks. If the branch lives longer than expected, merge the parent branch (the trunk or original feature branch) into your branch once in a while. Alternatively, you can also rebase your branch to the parent branch again. This way you can solve the conflicts in your branch. For more information on the differences between merging and rebasing, see Merging vs. Rebasing. Once you create a merge request, your remote repository will tell you if there are merge conflicts.

They are most commonly used to demark versions (draft, release candidates, or full releases). Tags are a feature provided by Git. By extension, they are also available in the remote repositories using Git. Git does not specify any particular syntax. ASAM and the CI pipelines in the remote repositories, however, require one, depending on the current project phase. A project MUST create a tag in the following instances: Any time a document has to be shared outside the project, i.e. The document of this repository is to be released/published or submitted to TSC A review is to be started A major milestone has been hit and its progress has to be specifically documented Only tagged (i.e. versioned) documents may be shared officially outside the project group.

It must be possible for every project member to contribute to and give feedback on the content of a Proposal document directly. For this purpose, all content discussions shall happen through issues in a project’s issue board. If your project is on ASAM GitLab, see the GitLab instructions for creating issues. If your project is on GitHub, see the GitHub instructions for creating issues. A clean issue contains the following things: active milestone assignee labels PROPOSAL Participants shall gather content for sections in issues in the proposal repository and discuss them there. If the Proposal is for an update of an existing ASAM standard, consider collecting and using backlog issues from the previous project first. DEVELOPMENT Every topic shall have its own issue. DEVELOPMENT only If a topic is too complex for a single issue, sub-issues shall be created. DEVELOPMENT only An issue with sub-issues shall only be closed if all its sub-issues have been closed. If an issue has a branch, the issue shall not be closed before the branch has been merged or closed. Issues shall be created using the provided issue templates in the repository.

Creating an issue from a template PROPOSAL The name of the issue shall correspond to the respective section. Figure 2. Topic issue for a proposal’s Executive Summary DEVELOPMENT The name of the issue shall follow the Branch naming conventions. The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently. Each issue and merge/pull request must apply labels as defined in Issue and merge request labels. A project may also have project-specific labels in addition to the official ones, specified directly in the project group. The Content of issues is discussed and resolved through comments and replies to previous comments. The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue. In the case of a feature or chapter description, it contains the current content of that chapter. It shall always be up-to-date and contain the latest discussed and approved version. In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic. In the latter case, the content shall only be updated to correct mistakes therein. A comment to an issue is a new topic that is independent from any previous comment. GitLab GitLab instructions for commenting GitHub GitHub instructions for commenting Before you add a new comment to an issue, make sure it is not a duplicate (i.e. the same or a similar comment already exists) and that it is not supposed to be a reply! Failure to do so will prevent efficient project progress. A reply is a comment created as a reply to a previous comment. In the issue, it is a child comment to the previous one and listed in relation to it. GitLab GitLab instructions for threads/replies GitHub GitHub instructions for communication If you want to reply to a previous comment, make sure to create a reply, not a new comment! An issues shall be closed once its discussion is resolved. Possible reasons: The questions of the issue have been answered The bug has been fixed and the fixes have been reviewed and merged The feature has been developed, reviewed, and merged It is best practice to close an issue immediately after one of the closing conditions has been met. Additionally, an issue may also be closed without resolution if it has become obsolete it is a duplicate (i.e. another issue deals with the same topic already) it has not been worked on for a long period of time (see The issue triage) ASAM has defined a process for closing outdated issues. This is called the \"Issue Triage\" or \"Ticket Triage\". See Ticket triage for more details.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users cannot commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in development or feature branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another feature branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Users MAY branch off the trunk for more focused development work. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label {requires:Clarification} to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label {isStatus:Duplicate} and assign the WG LEAD The WG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to {requires:Clarification} and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue, applying the Branch Naming Conventions Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to {requires:ConceptualWork} to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch, adhering to the Commit Message Conventions Review implementation progress of issue with WG LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Work Group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to {requires:CCBReview} If changes were developed in draft sections, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to {isStatus:WontBeFixed} and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Both tips reduce the chance for Merge Conflicts. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button.

You can see the full range and examples on the official website. The AsciiDoc extension for Visual Studio Code (see Recommended Visual Studio Code Extensions) comes with the ability to include Kroki diagrams. However, it is deactivated by default and must be configured before first use. This requires a diagram server. There are multiple options: Use the public kroki.io server Deploy your own server Run a kroki docker container on your local machine We will go with option 1. This extension will send graph information to https://kroki.io. If this is an issue, it is also possible to use your own kroki instance (see here for more information). To enable diagram support, set the use_kroki parameter in your User Settings to true. Open the Command Pallette (Ctrl+Shift+P) Type \"user settings\" and confirm with Enter Search for \"kroki\" in the user settings and enable the \"Use_kroki\" checkbox This is a per-file setting and must be done in each applicable AsciiDoc file. By default, diagrams are not saved locally. To cache and save diagrams locally, set the kroki-fetch-diagram attribute in your document header: = My amazing document :kroki-fetch-diagram: This will store images by default in your document folder. However, you may also set imagesdir to store them elsewhere: = My amazing document :kroki-fetch-diagram: :imagesdir: images In the example above, the images are now stored in a folder named \"images\". The images are served over http:// and you must allow your preview to include data from unsafe sources. To do this: Open the Command Pallette (Ctrl+Shift+P) Enter asciidoc preview security .

The Antora output has been built locally. Docker must be installed and running. To use the provided script, Python must be installed (during installation, check the box \"Add Python [version] to PATH\"). The generator repository for your project has been checked out. For development projects, the generator repository is located here: https://code.asam.net/internal/examples/antora-base-repo-example Check the generator’s 'site.yml' configuration For local builds, the url under content/sources must be local. Typically, this is \"./foldername\", where \"foldername\" is the name of the folder the content was checked out into Ensure that you use the branches and/or tags you want to build Run the scripts/build.py Python script: python scripts/build.py → The generated page automatically opens in the browser (Chrome). To build the content without opening it automatically, add -s after \"build.py\" To reopen the last build, add -f after \"build.py\" To get more information on possible options, type -h after \"build.py\" The example below shows the differences between a remote build setup and a local build setup. All changes are applied in the project’s site.yml. Remote build Local build Build using the GitHub repository, the branches \"main\" and \"pre-restructuring\", and all tagged versions starting with \"v\". Use the folder \"content\" in the repository for this content source. content: sources: - url: https://github.com/asam-ev/asam-project-guide-content.git # - url: ./asam-project-guide-content branches: main, pre-restructuring # branches: main tags: v* start_path: content Build using the local folder \"asam-project-guide-content\" and only the branch \"main\". Use the folder \"content\" in the repository for this content source. content: sources: # - url: https://github.com/asam-ev/asam-project-guide-content.git - url: ./asam-project-guide-content # branches: main, pre-restructuring branches: main # tags: v* start_path: content The most likely reason here is that you are trying to build two separate branches or tags that have identical component descriptors (typically, these are named \"antora.yml\"). The default component descriptor applies automatic versioning based on git values. However, some configuration may lead to two separate branches or tags getting the same version in Antora. In this case, update at least one of the impacted component descriptors so that its version is different from the other. To do so, you can either set a manual value or update the rules that are applied the refname. The script must be executed from the correct folder. Navigate to the folder where the script is located. Open a terminal window Execute 'python build.py' Unfortunately, there are some features that will not be available without python (i.e. the custom macros and summary features). If you cannot use python for whatever reason, you may use a python docker container and run everything from within there. If you had already set up the Antora image with the one-time step docker-compose build antora before and it stopped working, there is a chance that some technical changes have been made. To switch to the newest setup, run 'docker-compose down' to stop any currently running docker-compose, delete the image related to the project-guide antora setup (e.g. \"asam-project-guide_antora\") with the docker rmi command (see docker rmi --help for more information) You might need to force the deletion! prune the volume used by antora re-do the \"only required once\" steps Any program that blocks the site folder will stop Antora from generating the new pages. The reason is that it needs to delete the existing folder first before the new content is then written into it. Make sure that no program is currently accessing and blocking files or folders from the \"./site\" path.

In case a new project is proposed, the first step is to create an Executive Draft for internal analysis. Based on this draft, a rough Proposal Draft is then created that contains further details needed for the Proposal Workshop. This Proposal Draft is later further expanded and detailed until it is ready for submission to the TSC. The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be. A valid Project Proposal is created that can be brought to decision by the TSC. The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files, but the initial executive draft may be a Word document. For proposal submission, the proposal document must be converted into the appropriate Asciidoc structure. The idea has been proposed and approved in the Ideation Phase. The proposal needs at least three (3) partner companies.

Summary Purpose Develop supplementary products supporting the application of ASAM standards Funding Limit none Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase Description An implementation project has the purpose to create a supplementary product to a standard that supports the implementation or application of an ASAM standard in the industry. Goal The result of an implementation project can be a tool or source code, such as checkers for file formats and APIs, add-ons or plug-ins for commonly used IDEs, importers, exporters or reference implementations. Promoting specific commercial tools shall be avoided. Repository suffix Implementation An implementation project has the purpose to create a supplementary product that supports the ap-plication of an ASAM standard in the industry. An ASAM product shall cover one of the following use-cases: supports the development of standard-based, commercial products(e.g. development tool kit) ensures standard-based interoperability of commercial products(e.g. source code) reduce the development costs of commercial products(e.g. source code) is used for testing the standard compliance of commercial products(e.g. checker tool, test suite, source code) Another auxiliary purpose of an implementation project can be to support the standard development by providing feedback from the implementers to the standard developers to improve the quality and maturity of the standard while it is still in development. For liability reasons, ASAM shall develop and distribute source code only as a result of an implementation project. Members may use the source code to create tools or other executables from the source code. As an example, implementation projects may include the development of source code for one of the following products. This list is not exhaustive and should only serve as a guideline of what might be a meaningful, supplementary product to an ASAM standard. Checker tool for syntax checks of non-schema-based file formats Checker tool for plausibility checks of schema-based file formats Checker tool for API checks Add-on or plug-in for de-facto standard IDEs (e.g. MATLAB, Simulink, Eclipse etc.) Importers or parsers Exporters or generators Reference implementations of tools or tool components Behavioral software components Additions to popular open-source projects (e.g. Eclipse, openMDM, Artop, etc.) API stubs and skeletons The deliverable(s) of an implementation project must have product-quality. Consequently, ASAM products are professionally developed in accordance to customary quality guidelines of the automotive or IT industries, whichever is applicable. This requires that the software is developed by a contractor, while the ASAM project group controls and reviews the contractor’s implementation. For example, schemata definition files shall be commented. Further rules and guidelines for this project type are set forth in the document \"GuidelinesForASAMCheckerTools\". Upon request, ASAM provides funding up to 100% of the project’s required budget. Excluded are expenses for meeting participation and travel.

The following process steps are not mandatory and are skipped by default, unless otherwise decided by the TSC or the project group: P1: Proposal Workshop C: Review Phase When members propose the further development of a standard, for which an ASAM product exists, members must also propose the further development of this product, unless the pro-posed changes of the standard have no impact on the product. If the ASAM product shall not be further developed, then ASAM shall publicly announce that the development of the product is discontinued. ASAM products shall not compete with a member company’s product business(non-competition clause). Members can object an implementation project proposal and shall provide a justification for their objection. The TSC checks during P5 Project Approval, whether the objection is justified. In case of a justified objection, the TSC shall not approve the proposed project or decide on measures that would remove the member’s objection.

In these, workgroup members define the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated). Goal The goal is to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. Repository suffix Standard All variants use the same repository suffix. The core of ASAM is to carry out standard development projects with the goal to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. ASAM defines four types of standard development projects, depending on the expected magnitude of changes to the standard: New standard Major version update Minor version update Revision They all have in common that the primary output of the project is a standard. The upper limit for subsidiary funding from ASAM is 25% of the total required project budget. Table 1. Summary Purpose Create a new standard. Version 1.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A new standard is developed from the outset. There is no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio, or the predecessor has been declared as 'deprecated'. A new ASAM standard can be a transfer from another organization or an extension of a standard from another standardization organization. Start the development of a completely new standard within ASAM. The development project meets one of the following criteria: There exists no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio. A predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio was deprecated and a new standard in the same technology area shall be developed from scratch. The new standard is an extension, substitution or parallel development of a standard from another standardization organization. A new ASAM standard gets the version number \"1.0.0\". If a new standard replaces a deprecated standard, then the new standard cannot have the same name than the deprecated standard. Table 2. Summary Purpose Add major features Make significant changes to existing features Version X.0.0 New Features yes Backward compatible n.a. Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process A major version development project introduces significant changes to the standard, e.g. the addition of a new major feature or significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor. Major version developments of ASAM standards introduce significant changes to the standard. Major version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Addition of a new, major feature. Significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor versions. The number of major version releases meets the pattern: \"X.0.0\". X is an integer number starting with 2. Table 3. Summary Purpose Add minor features Make minor changes to existing feature Version ?.X.0 New Features yes Backward compatible yes Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase A minor version development project introduces changes to existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Minor version developments of ASAM standards introduce changes t existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard. Minor version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Addition of new features, which are considered as small relative to existing features. Insignificant changes or additions to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A new minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: \"?.X.0\". X is an integer number starting with 1. ? is the current major release number. The following process steps are not mandatory and are skipped by default, unless otherwise decided by the TSC or the project group: P1: ProposalWorkshop C: Review Phase Table 4. Summary Purpose Correct errors Remove ambiguities Add clarifications Make editorial improvements Change/add examples Version ?.?.X New Features n.a Backward compatible yes Funding Limit 25% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase A revision version development project resolves technical issues of the standard, i.e. corrects errors, removes ambiguities, adds clarifications to existing descriptions, makes editorial improvements or changes examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. A new revision version of an ASAM standard is always backward-compatible. Revision version developments of ASAM standards resolve technical issues with the currently released version of the standard. Revision version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Correction of errors. Removal of ambiguities. Addition of clarifications to existing descriptions. Editorial improvements. Any kind of changes to examples, including the addition of examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration ef-forts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. The only exception is, that a new feature has been forgotten in an earlier release of the standard and is absolutely required for a functional and meaningful standard. A new revision version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. The only exception is, that the correction of an error or the removal of an ambiguity cannot be reasonably solved in any other way than breaking the backward-compatibility. An exception requires approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Revision development projects may be converted to a minor or major version development project during the course of the project term, if backward-compatibility issues turn out to be too severe or new features need to be added. The TSC has to approve this change of project type. Only those ASAM members, who were actively involved in development of the preceding major or minor version, can participate in the revision development project. Revision projects are limited to a life cycle of up to 18 months. Unlike other project types, the paid Service Provider for a revision project can be contracted without a public request for quotation. The Service Provider is confirmed by the TSC and is appointed before the project starts. The Project Leader and the Service Provider must be employees from different companies. The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: \"?.?.X\". X is an integer number starting with 1. ? represents the current major and minor release number.

Repository suffix Study Study projects provide members an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards in a collaborative way. Study projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards among the participants, to promote their application in member companies and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards. This project type is specifically intended for members in regions, where ASAM standards are not well known. The content of study projects can be, but is not limited to: collaborative self-study of an ASAM standard receive training on an ASAM standard carry out a suitability analysis of an ASAM standard against defined use-cases carry out a pilot project to become familiar with the practical application of ASAM-related tools carry out an interoperability analysis of ASAM-related tools Study projects have no expected deliverables other than a final report. The members of study projects shall be pledged to submit change requests, if they find issues or gaps in ASAM standards. The standard development process does not apply for study projects in case that either no budget or a small budget is needed. The process to request, approve and carrying out a study project is: Member submits a study project information sheet to the ASAM Office for project approval. ASAM Office checks the information and approves or rejects the project. ASAM Office informs the TSC about the project. ASAM Office publishes an announcement of the project. The study project starts and is being carried out as described in the study project information sheet. The ASAM Office monitors the project activities. Some further rules apply for study projects: Participation in study projects is open for all ASAM members, e.g. also to members in a non \"active\"membership class. Participation in a study project can be restricted to members of a specific region, e.g. Japan only. The working language can be different than English. The project members elect a Project Leader. Meetings are documented via meeting minutes in English language. The minutes may be translated into the working language of the study group. The project members use the ASAM IT infrastructure. Upon request, ASAM provides funding for study projects up to the limit for small budget projects. In case that a larger budget is required beyond the limit of a small budget project, then the project must be requested via the regular project proposal process, which consist of the process steps P2 Proposal Writing, P3 Proposal Submission, P4 Proposal Publication and P5 Proposal Decision by the TSC.","title":"Study project","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"project-type-study","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/TBD/project-type-study.html","titles":[{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":1},{"text":"Project type description","hash":"_project_type_description","id":2}]},"156":{"id":156,"text":"To make a good faith effort to ensure licensing criteria are met, ASAM open source projects require the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process to be followed. The DCO is an attestation attached to every contribution made by every developer. In the commit message of the contribution, (described more fully later in this document), the developer simply adds a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO. When a developer submits a patch, it is a commitment that the contributor has the right to submit the patch per the standard license. The DCO agreement is shown below and online. Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 By making a contribution to this project, I certify that: (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as Indicated in the file; or (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it. (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved. The DCO requires a sign-off message in the following format appear on each commit in the pull request: Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname The DCO text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either -s or --signoff to your usual Git commit commands. If you forget to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit with the sign-off by running git commit --amend -s. You can add sign-offs to multiple commits (including commits originally authored by others, if you are authorized to do so) using git rebase --signoff. If you’ve pushed your changes to GitHub already you’ll need to force push your branch after this with git push --force-with-lease. If you want to be reminded to add the sign-off for commits in your repository, you can add the following commit-message git hook to your repository: #!/bin/sh # = Check for DCO/Signed-off-by in message # if ! grep -q \"^Signed-off-by: \" \"$1\" then echo \"Aborting commit: Commit message is not signed off\" >&2 exit 1 fi Placing this script into a file called .git/hooks/commit-msg and making it executable (e.g. using chmod a+x .git/hooks/commit-msg on unixoid operating systems) will prevent commits that do not have a sign-off.

TECHNICAL WRITER SERVICE PROVIDER Docker is a platform where you use so-called containers to run applications in an encapsulated environment. With this, you do not need to install and configure software, programming languages etc: just download and use a pre-configured container that has all the relevant configuration already built in. From the docker homepage: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Figure 1. The Docker architecture For Asciidoc, docker can be used to run a pre-configured asciidoctor setup for creating html output locally. This removes the need to upload adoc files and use the build pipeline for every change you want to see. It also means you do not have to install and configure Asciidoctor first since this is already done in the pre-configured Docker image. If you do not have Docker installed, check out the Docker before continuing. If your project is currently missing the docker-compose.yml, see these Standard Docker-Compose YAML on how to set it up. A project’s final specification document is created as HTML file. However, having to run it through the pipeline every time before being able to see the final result after having made changes is neither efficient nor friendly to the other workgroup members. To render a project’s documentation without having to upload it, use Docker Compose with a correctly defined docker-compose.yml file.

PROJECT PARTICIPANT TECHNICAL WRITER SERVICE PROVIDER Draw.io is a free tool for creating diagrams. The tool can be downloaded and run locally (as Draw.io Desktop), accessed through a web browser (through Draw.io web link with ASAM library), or be used through the Visual Studio Code extension (id: hediet.vscode-drawio).

A typical cycle lasts for two (2) months. During this period, each WG will schedule one or more Work Group Meetings. Additionally, the Project Lead (and possibly the CCB) may meet with the WG Leads in one or more WG Lead Meetings. Finally, the CCB may schedule CCB Meetings.

This page covers the Development Cycle and all its sub-steps as well as participating in relevant Controlling Meetings. Each sub-step is further detailed on its respective page. Figure 1. The Development phase’s main cycle in detail, using the ASAM Project Phase Notation While the project is actively being developed, it follows the main development cycle of planning, developing, and reviewing. Occasionally, there are project-independent events happening, such as \"Controlling Meetings\", where each project may or must participate in. In particular, there are the CGSim Controlling Meetings (mandatory for all Simulation Domain projects during the Development phase) and the TSC Controlling Meetings. Typically, projects present their current (i.e. the latest updated) status report to allow the respective panel to monitor and intervene, if necessary. Each project defines their own timeline during the Proposal phase. Therefore, there is no standard Development phase timeline. However, there are typical categories for project length. These are shown below. Additionally, a project may request additional time if the project’s content turns out to be more complex than anticipated. The Development phase consists of the following steps, which are explained in detail in their own sections: Cycle planning Cycle development Cycle review Controlling Meetings TSC Controlling Meeting CGSim Controlling Meeting Purpose To plan the next development cycle on both a high and a low level in form of a milestone Responsible PROJECT LEAD + CCB Member; WG LEAD Involved WG LEAD; PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER This is a multi-step task. The Project Lead, together with the CCB, specifies the high level goals for the project’s next development cycle. They then present and discuss the created milestone with the WG Leads. After the overall goals have been specified and communicated, the WG Leads specify the detailed goals for the respective involved Working Groups. They then present and discuss both the global and the detailed goals of the milestone with the WG members, the involved Service Providers, and the Technical Writers. See Development cycle — Planning. Purpose To develope the content for the planned milestone. Responsible PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER Involved PROJECT LEAD, WG LEAD This is a multi-step task. During the development cycle, each work group individually works on their respective topics (if any). Each work group will also meet regularly in its Work Group Meetings. Note that each work group may define the intervals and modalities of their meetings for themselves. To coordinate activities between different Work Groups, ASAM recommends that all WG Leads meet regularly during each cycle. Each project may define their own intervals for WG Lead meetings. In addition to that, the CCB may meet regularly or triggered by specific events to review and merge urgent topics as well as discuss other project-related topics. Similarly to the Work Group Meetings, each project may define their own intervals for CCB meetings. See Development cycle — Development. Purpose To review the achievements for the planned milestone and to create a project status report. Responsible PROJECT LEAD + CCB Member; WG LEAD Involved WG LEAD; PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER Each cycle ends with a project meeting where the project process is assessed and the project status report is updated. The project status is then presented at the next CGSim Controlling Meeting. See Development cycle — Review. This is a Full Project Meeting. The Full project meeting/workshop guidelines apply. Purpose To discuss how the latest cycle went and find out, whether processes can and must be improved or not. Responsible PROJECT LEAD Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, SERVICE PROVIDER, TECHNICAL WRITER No process is perfect, and every initial assumption and definition may be imperfect. For this reason, ASAM recommends doing a Cycle Retrospective meeting after every cycle. The idea is to identify methods, processes, and topics that proved to work great and should be kept as well as topics that turned out to be inefficient or problematic and should be changed or improved. This way, each project can improve not only its content, but also its way of working together to become more efficient and increase their work quality over time. Ideally, these lessons learned are documented and, if generally applicable, used to improve this Project Guide around the project’s conclusion.

Click here to learn more about how you can contribute to it directly. The Project Proposal is an AsciiDoc document laying out the proposed project for a new standard / version of a released standard. The Project Proposal template is located in the ASAM GitLab, where you can find more information on its structure and default content. Each proposal must cover the following topics: Commitments Project timeline Project deliverables Project structure Additional project funding Market analysis/relevance Relevance to ASAM Project type Prospect participants of the project must commit to it ahead of time. There are different types of commitments possible: Content commitment Review commitment Each type comes with requirements that are explained in their respective section. TODO TODO Each project must plan its own timeline ahead of time. Since things change, the timeline may be altered later. However, the timeline should still be realistic with the knowledge available during the proposal phase. The Project Timeline must contain milestones for each Project Deliverable and account for Kickoff Start of review End of review Finalization Presentation at TSC Target release date The duration of the plan shall not exceed 1.5 years. The proposal must define the deliverables it intends to hand over to ASAM at the end of the project. The deliverables of a standard package consist of standard documents and other files. A standard package consists of at least one base standard. Other deliverable items, as listed on this page, are optional. Base standard A base standard contains all fundamental specifications such as abstract object models, syntax definitions and functional behavior descriptions. It uses a problem- or task-oriented notation, such as UML or BNF. A base standard is technology- and implementation-independent. Each ASAM standard consists of one base standard document. Some base standards at ASAM are split-up into two documents, which is the Reference Guide, which contains all formal specifications of the standard in a reference-book style, and the User’s Guide, which further specifies the application of the standard. All other standard documents within a standard package are associated to the base standard, and are of one of the following types: Companion standard The notion of companion standard is typically used for application- or device-specific extensions of a base standard. Technology reference Technology references map the abstract specifications of the base standard to specific technologies, e.g. programming langages or data-base implementations. Transport Layer Specification Transport layer specifications are similar to technology references, as they also provide a technology mapping. The notion of transport layer specification is used in the area of communication technologies. They provide a mapping of the base standard to specific protocol- or bus-technologies. The transport layer abstracts access of higher application layers to the lower layers of the communication system. Model files Model files typically contain the object model of the standard. A typical example of a model file in ASAM standards are UML models created with the tool \"Enterprise Architect\" (.ea). Schema files Schema files define the formal structure and syntax of text files. They are used for automated schema validation. Typical examples of schema files are XML definition files (.xsd) or Google protocol buffers definition files (.proto). Interface definition files Interface definition files define programmatic interfaces, such as APIs (Application Programming Interface). They are used for automatic code generation of the standardized interface for specific programming languages. A typical example of an interface definition file is the Interface Description Language file (.idl). Example files Example files demonstrate a typical and standard-compliant implementation of the standard. The proposal must specify the expected working groups and their designated leads. The proposal must also define the expected roles (see ASAM roles for typical role specifications) in the project. The proposal must define whether additional funding beyond the standard budget calculation is required. The proposal must provide an initial market analysis and show the relevance for it. A standard without merit is not to be supported by ASAM. Similarly, a standard with (nearly) identical content as another standard is obsolete. TODO The proposal must specify the type of project it wants to start.","title":"The Proposal document","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"proposal_document","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/getting-involved/proposal/proposal_document.html","titles":[{"text":"Commitments","hash":"_commitments","id":1},{"text":"Content commitment","hash":"_content_commitment","id":2},{"text":"Review commitment","hash":"_review_commitment","id":3},{"text":"Project timeline","hash":"_project_timeline","id":4},{"text":"Project deliverables","hash":"_project_deliverables","id":5},{"text":"Standard documents","hash":"_standard_documents","id":6},{"text":"Other files","hash":"_other_files","id":7},{"text":"Project structure","hash":"_project_structure","id":8},{"text":"Additional project funding","hash":"_additional_project_funding","id":9},{"text":"Market analysis/relevance","hash":"_market_analysisrelevance","id":10},{"text":"Relevance to ASAM","hash":"_relevance_to_asam","id":11},{"text":"Project type","hash":"_project_type","id":12}]},"187":{"id":187,"text":"Responsible GTM Involved Idea Giver, PROJECT PARTICIPANT Step TL;DR Use the Proposal Workshop Gameplan Schedule the meeting >=4 weeks ahead of time Add event to website Reserve room/online meeting This page covers how to set up a proposal workshop.

The Project Proposal is a written document that is submitted to the TSC for project approval before any project at ASAM may start. All committed participants (the Idea Giver, the Proposal Submitter, and all prospective Workgroup Members) can participate in writing the proposal document (the Proposal Submitter actually has to participate in the finalization step). See The Proposal document for more information on the document and its intended contents. You must first complete the Minimum Required Setup before you can participate in and contribute to any project. Participation in the creation of a Project Proposal follows the central Trunk-based Workflow at ASAM. If you want to learn more about this workflow, click the link. To contribute to a Project Proposal, project members can either contribute through GitLab issues or contribute directly in AsciiDoc. However, at least one person must transfer all content to the AsciiDoc file eventually. Both ways of contribution can be performed without software installation directly through the respective web interface. If you prefer to work on your local computer, see the list of recommended tools. The content of a Proposal document shall be drafted and discussed through issues in the project’s issue board. ASAM provides guidelines on how to contribute through issues on the page Proposal phase contribution guidelines. All participants must follow these guidelines. The project may decide to contribute directly in AsciiDoc as well. However, content shall still be discussed and updated in issues as described in Contributing through issues. When writing AsciiDoc, writers must follow the guidelines described in Contributing in AsciiDoc files as well as the ASAM Editorial Guide. The content that is defined in the project’s issues must be transferred to AsciiDoc eventually. ASAM recommends that the project defines one or more writers responsible for this task. When writing AsciiDoc, writers must follow the guidelines described in Contributing in AsciiDoc files as well as the ASAM Editorial Guide. ASAM provides an Editorial Guide containing the writing guidelines applicable to all ASAM documents. The current version of the Editorial Guide is located in the Project Guide Compendium. The Editorial Guide is mandatory for all Technical Writers and recommended for users contributing content through issues. Responsible Idea Giver Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, GTM Step TL;DR Write the Motivation section Define use cases Refer to known existing standards Fill in all technical chapters Discuss and optimize together with ASAM Office The ASAM Office assists the writer(s) by giving advice with respect to ASAM guideline and best practices. In case a new project is proposed, the first step is to create an Executive Draft for internal analysis. Based on this draft, a rough Proposal Draft is then created that contains further details needed for the Proposal Workshop. This Proposal Draft is later further expanded and detailed until it is ready for submission to the TSC. The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be. A valid Project Proposal is created that can be brought to decision by the TSC. The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files, but the initial executive draft may be a Word document. For proposal submission, the proposal document must be converted into the appropriate Asciidoc structure. The idea has been proposed and approved in the Ideation Phase. The proposal needs at least three (3) partner companies. Access the project’s online repository through the link provided by your GTM Optionally, check out the project repository or download the Executive Draft template and edit the AsciiDoc files directly. You must update the content of each chapter’s issue regardless of if you write in the AsciiDoc files directly or not! Fill in the default structure as follows (in the respective issues): Add a comprehensive 'Executive Summary' outlining the general idea of the proposed project Describe the reasons for this proposed project in the 'Motivation' section Define a set of (initial) use cases in the 'Use Cases' section (OPTIONAL) If you know of other standards this proposal relates to (ASAM or other), list them in the 'Relations to Other Standards or Organizations' section (OPTIONAL) Create an initial structure for the section 'Technical Content' and fill write as much project specific content as possible Discuss and optimize the document with your GTM Transfer the issues' content to the project’s AsciiDoc files. The GTM will support you with this task, if needed. Note that you do not need to render the document manually. The repository’s pipeline will create the required documents as artifacts automatically when the changes are committed and pushed to the trunk. See Access compiled artifacts to learn more about pipeline artifacts and how you can access them. The sections 'Project Resources' and 'Project Plan' will be filled out at a later stage and do not need to be edited in this draft. Responsible Involved PROJECT PARTICIPANT, GTM Step TL;DR Create the milestone plan Finalize content for submission Review content with proposal team Once the Proposal Workshop has taken place, the Proposal must be finalized. To do so, the Proposal Submitter (and all other involved writers) shall consider the following input for finalizing the project proposal: the existing Proposal draft meeting minutes of the Proposal Workshop relevant papers from concept projects (if any) The Submitter shall estimate the work efforts of the project and create a milestone plan. The duration of the plan shall not exceed 1.5 years. The Office then checks the proposal document for formal compliance and understandability. The proposal may contain a request for video conferencing support through the Office, if project group members originate from locations that would require long-distance (i.e. inter-continental) business trips to regularly participate at project meetings. The Submitter shall send out the proposal to all participants of the Proposal Workshop (if this occurred) for review before submitting it.","title":"Writing a Project Proposal","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"proposal_writing","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/getting-involved/proposal/proposal_writing.html","titles":[{"text":"The proposal document","hash":"_the_proposal_document","id":1},{"text":"How to contribute","hash":"_how_to_contribute","id":2},{"text":"Contributing through issues","hash":"_contributing_through_issues","id":3},{"text":"Contributing directly in AsciiDoc","hash":"_contributing_directly_in_asciidoc","id":4},{"text":"Transferring content to AsciiDoc","hash":"_transferring_content_to_asciidoc","id":5},{"text":"ASAM Editorial Guide","hash":"_asam_editorial_guide","id":6},{"text":"Writing the Proposal draft","hash":"_writing_the_proposal_draft","id":7},{"text":"Context","hash":"_context","id":8},{"text":"Result","hash":"_result","id":9},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":10},{"text":"How","hash":"_how","id":11},{"text":"Finalizing the Proposal","hash":"_finalizing_the_proposal","id":12}]},"189":{"id":189,"text":"Responsible GTM Involved Idea Giver, PROJECT PARTICIPANT Step TL;DR If completely new, create new subgroup with the proposed project name in Simulation and add members If not new, update the assigned members Fork the proposal template repository into this proposal subgroup as \" Proposal\" Inform members The basis for collaboration on Proposals at ASAM is GitLab.

Consequently, a project may only move from Proposal phase to Standard Development phase if at least one project member has declared their candidacy for Project Lead. In most projects, the Idea Giver candidates for Project Lead, but this is not a requirement. The Project Lead is the main responsible for a project. They coordinate general activities, track the progression, decide on changes and the project direction, and are the main contact point for ASAM for that project. Often, the original Idea Giver or the Proposal Submitter also become the Project Lead, but this is not mandatory. A Project Lead is responsible both for the project’s content and its coordination. However, a project can decide to pass the organizational tasks on to a contracted project support (typically: a Service Provider) so that the Project Lead can focus on the content specification of the project.

PROJECT LEAD GTM Moderator must be neutral Allow all opinions. Hold back own opinion and proposals. Drive consensus building​ independent of own position. Accept the majority.​ Do not be judgmental. Let the group be judgmental: Yes ​ No \"That is excellent!\" → \"What do the others think about it? \"That is nonsense!\"​ → \"Does anyone has objections about that proposal?\" \"Let’s do this!\"​ → \"Should we do this?\" Moderator can voice his opinion and make own proposals Moderator must still remain neutral when managing the meeting. Give other opinions and proposals the same attention than yours.​ Moderator should send a second employee, who can openly represent the company’s opinion and proposals. Moderator must treat him like everyone else.​ Moderator must have technical competence in the standard’s subject matter In case the number of people who come to meetings drop A small decline in participation is normal and shall be accepted. If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here. Remind people about their man-day commitments, too. Keep the discussion focused on topic Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic But let the discussion go for a while Drive discussion towards results/decisions (not towards own/right results/decisions) Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution Do not let the discussion become repetitive In case discussions are very controversial Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has been said, carry out a vote. If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something \"might not work\" or​ \"could be too slow\"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known. If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g. propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone ​ carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​ propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort) Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority. Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority. In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down Ask a member or the Service Provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic. In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on. Moderator takes the initiative and drives the discussion forward with his own proposals. This is typically a situation, where the moderator can give up neutrality a bit without doing damage to the meeting culture. Give a summary of what has been said. Propose a conclusion/decision Obtain consensus of the conclusion/decision Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo Carry out a vote if needed Document key-points of the discussion (in a projected memo TODO)","title":"OpenX Calendar - Best Practices","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"calendar-best-practices","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Tools/calendar/calendar-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"General tips","hash":"_general_tips","id":1},{"text":"General meeting guidelines","hash":"_general_meeting_guidelines","id":2},{"text":"Whom to invite","hash":"_whom_to_invite","id":3},{"text":"Setting up a meeting","hash":"_setting_up_a_meeting","id":4},{"text":"Related topics","hash":"_related_topics","id":5},{"text":"Meeting moderation","hash":"_meeting_moderation","id":6},{"text":"Meeting moderation best practices","hash":"_meeting_moderation_best_practices","id":7},{"text":"Before a meeting","hash":"_before_a_meeting","id":8},{"text":"During a meeting","hash":"_during_a_meeting","id":9},{"text":"At the end of a meeting","hash":"_at_the_end_of_a_meeting","id":10}]},"199":{"id":199,"text":"WG LEAD PROJECT LEAD All OpenX projects share a calendar under the email address of openx@asam.net.

If you are unsure if git is installed, you can check by entering the following in a shell window and confirming: git --version If a git version is returned, git is already installed on your system. If git is not installed, follow the instructions on how to install git After installation of Git, configure your user credentials that Git uses when checking in changed content from your PC to the ASAM GitLab. To make sure your commits match your name and email details, a one time configuration is necessary. Open a shell or terminal window Execute the following command and replace the entries \"FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME\" accordingly: git config --global user.name \"FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME\" Example 1. Setting git user name for Max Mustermann git config --global user.name Max Mustermann Next, execute the following command and replace the entry \"MY_NAME@example.com\" with your comany’s email: git config --global user.email \"MY_NAME@example.com\" Example 2. Setting email for Max Mustermann working at company git config --global user.email max.mustermann@company.com If no error is returned, the configuration step has been successful. To ensure you don’t have to enter your login details every time you want to interact with the repository, add an SSH key to your account. Generate an SSH key pair following the official instructions. Entering a passphrase is optional and leads to additional steps every time you connect to the remote, so it is not recommended. Add the generated SSH public key to your GitLab account by following these instructions. Verify that you can connect If you cannot click Next, make sure Visual Studio Code is already installed. Return to the previous step and continue again. Now, the Next button should be active. Make sure that the ssh-agent is running: Open a shell or terminal window Type the following command, hit Enter, and check the status: Get-Service ssh-agent If the status is \"Stopped\", type the following, hit Enter, and check the StartType.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users cannot commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in development or feature branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another feature branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Unless indicated by a clear git tag, all commits are considered to be part of a release candidate. Users MAY branch off the trunk for more focused development work. These branches SHOULD be short-lived ( Assign the issues to a responsible with @ Tips Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your development machine or process → set up .gitignore accordingly Create sub-issues in case an issue contains too much content for a short-lived implementation It may be necessary to create new issues during development as well, as new knowledge and information comes up. These have the same requirements and steps as those created at the beginning Who Assignee Steps Assign the label {requires:Clarification} to indicate this issue is being looked at and discussed. Coordinate and drive the preparation of a proposal for addressing the issue. Do this either directly via comments or in further meetings, adding the results to the comments later. If the analysis shows the issue is a duplicate to another issue in the same project: Assign the label {isStatus:Duplicate} and assign the WG LEAD The WG Lead reviews the issue and either closes it (if it is a duplicate) or changes the status back to {requires:Clarification} and the assignee back to the original issue assignee Tips If analysis shows an issue to contain too many steps, create sub-issues to split the topic up further for faster content implementation Who Assignee Steps Once a proposal is ready to be implemented, create a new development branch for the issue, applying the Branch Naming Conventions Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches Change the issue status label to {requires:ConceptualWork} to indicate that a proposal is being implemented for this issue Begin submitting work via commits to the develop branch, adhering to the Commit Message Conventions Review implementation progress of issue with WG LEAD and the other PROJECT PARTICIPANT in Work Group meetings Once the group agrees that the feature is complete: Change the issue status label to {requires:CCBReview} If changes were developed in draft sections, remove the encapsulating draft feature flag from the content (make sure that all other content remains within the draft flag) and commit the change. If there is no Merge/Pull Request for this branch yet, create one If a Merge/Pull Request exists and is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Add a comment to the Merge/Pull Request to ask for a review by the whole project and the implementers forum: /request_review @all. The MR MUST include document subsection number(s) being reviewed and a link to the lines of source code to be reviewed. Tips If at any point during the implementation the group decides the issue has become irrelevant or cannot be implemented, the status label is changed to {isStatus:WontBeFixed} and the issue is closed (as well as any related branches and Merge/Pull Requests) Issue branches SHOULD be short-lived (no more than 2 weeks) to ensure progress and direction are visible to project members and that it is not too out of sync with other activities. If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Both tips reduce the chance for Merge Conflicts. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident. Mark passages which are not ready for viewing in the final output as draft (see Mark passages as draft) The Review stage consists of the Internal review and the Change Control Board review Internal review Who All PROJECT PARTICIPANT & Implementers Forum Steps Submit feedback on the changes directly in the Merge/Pull Request General feedback: Submit a comment on the Merge/Pull Request Content specific feedback: Start a review in the changes tab of the Merge/Pull Request To start a review, write a comment on a diff as normal under the 'Changes' tab in a Merge/Pull Request and then select 'Start a review'. Click here for more information. If the review feedback requires further development work, the process restarts from the [Implementation] stage Tips Technical discussion happen in comments Change Control Board review Who CCB Steps If there are no unresolved comments or threads after two weeks, the CCB ends the review The Merge/Pull Request is assigned to the Service Provider for [Integration] Who SERVICE PROVIDER Steps The Service Provider changes the status label to {requires:DocumentationWork} The Service Provider refines the content in the Merge/Pull Request The content is adjusted to adhere to ASAM style and writing conventions General editorial rewrites to ensure homogeneity of content Questions on content should be addressed to the original issue assignee who will be responsible for ensuring a satisfactory resolution. In the case that questions lead to significant changes to the content, the MR is reopened for review on resolution. On completion of the integration: Set the status label of the Merge/Pull Request to {requires:CCBReview} Set to squash commits with fast-forward merging (default). Squash commit message MUST adhere to the Commit Message Conventions Who CCB Steps CCB performs a final review of the integrated content Is the original content still correctly represented? Are all guidelines & conventions maintained? Are all discussions resolved? Does it have a clear commit history that adheres to the Commit message conventions? If the review is not passed, return to [Integration] If the review is passed and the CCB can merge, the CCB merges the Merge/Pull Request back to the trunk The CCB removes the status label and closes the linked issue If the review is passed but the CCB may not merge, the CCB changes the status label to {requires:Merge} Tips Use a pull request for code reviews.

Description Standard development projects are the core of ASAM. In these, workgroup members define the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated). Goal The goal is to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. For more, see Standard development. Description An implementation project has the purpose to create a supplementary product to a standard that supports the implementation or application of an ASAM standard in the industry. Goal The result of an implementation project can be a tool or source code, such as checkers for file formats and APIs, add-ons or plug-ins for commonly used IDEs, importers, exporters or reference implementations. Promoting specific commercial tools shall be avoided. For more, see Implementation project. Description Concept projects have the purpose to prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards. They are typically chosen when the envisioned standard is complex and requires significant resources to even develop a sound and solid project proposal. Goal The goals of concept projects are to propose specific content for ASAM standards and/or to provide justification for the usefulness, practicability, and feasibility of the proposed content. For more, see Concept project. Description Study projects provide members, an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards in a collaborative way. Goal These projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards, to promote their application in member companies, and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards.

The project members must elect a project lead at the beginning of the project. {role-wg-member} A project member working in a particular workgroup, a subdivision of the overall project. If the project is split up into smaller workgroups, a project member can join a workgroup to become a workgroup member. WG LEAD If the project is split up into smaller workgroups, a project member can be elected to be the workgroup lead and will support the project lead. Each workgroup should have zero or one workgroup lead. SERVICE PROVIDER Provides additional services necessary for the standard development. If the project needs additional resources, a service provider can be hired, which requires an approved budget by the TSC. TECHNICAL WRITER Formats and writes the document(s) of the standard based on the provided input from the WG members in a formalized and standard-conform way.

General configuration for ASAM Antora extensions in site.yml - id: asam-extensions enabled: false require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js' The following sections describe features directly applied through the pipeline. The ASAM Antora extension finds all pages not listed in any nav.adoc and puts a warning in the console output. If configured, these pages can also automatically be listed under a separated navigation entry (e.g. \"orphans\") at the end of the Antora document. For more details, see Pipeline: Orphan pages. The ASAM Antora extension generates an overview page that lists all keywords used in the Antora pages. The location and the (virtual) filename can be configured in the site.yml (Antora playbook). For more details, see Pipeline: Keyword page. To see the result of the applied pipeline feature, see Used keywords In ASAM Project Guide By default, Antora does not support sequential page numbering. However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters. In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages. Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages. To fulfill this requirement, the \"Page numbering\" extension features were implemented. These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two (\"== \") sections on each page). Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential figure and table numbers. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential numbering. Since Asciidoctor counts all images and tables only within each page, their caption numbers start at 1 on every new Antora page by default. In case of standards, these numbers must be sequential (and unique) within each standard, not each page. Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential section numbers and page titles. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential figure and table numbers. By default, section numbers in Asciidoctor have a trailing dot (\".\"). To be in line with ISO 2145, sections in standards have to be numbered without this trailing dot. The Antora extension in combination with the 'sectnums_to_iso' extension for Asciidoctor address this problem. For more details, see Pipeline: ISO-2145 style section and page numbering. Using Asciidoctor, it is typical to create one main file and include content from separate files. With this approach, each section or chapter can be managed separately while still compiling everything into a single final document. However, in Antora these sections or chapters stay separate in most cases since the idea is to be able to access them individually and independently. When working with documents originally intended for a single-file-inclusion strategy, local references that only work if other files are also included will not work for the individual pages in Antora. To circumvent this problem, the ASAM Antora extensions analyze all pages and try to find the source file of the reference. If the content is included in multiple pages, pages in the navigation structured are prioritized over unlisted pages. Note, however, that this approach has limitations and should only be used if switching to a more Antora-native approach is too difficult! For more details, see Pipeline: Local to global anchor replacement. ASAM macros are not supported in partials as they are replaced through Antora rather than Asciidoctor, but partials are included by Asciidoctor at a later stage. Add related::[] in an empty line and replace with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference. You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword. To negate a keyword, use an exclamationmark (!) in front of it. See: Macro: related Add reference::[] in an empty line and replace with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference. You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword. To negate a keyword, use an exclamationmark (!) in front of it. See: Macro: reference Add page::[] in an empty line and replace with a list of arguments, separated by \",\" (comma). If you add no arguments, the macro will list all other pages in the same folder as this file. See: Macro: pages Add role_related::[] in an empty line and replace with a list of role labels, separated by \",\" (comma), and with an (optional) list of limiting keywords, separated by \",\" (comma). See: Macro: role_related This ONLY works in nav.adoc files, not in regular pages or partials! The macro must also always be used as a comment (similarly to the Asciidoctor macro \"tag\"). If the module has a main page, add //autonav::[] without parameters in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. If the module has no main page, add //autonav::[none] in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. The macro uses the following rules to determine the main page of a module: If there is a file named like the module on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"index.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"main.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else use the first page in the alphabetically sorted list. See: Macro: autonav The source code can be found in the ASAM GitLab repository.

There are two types of standards: Base standards and associated standards. Standards can consist of several parts. These parts are independent (e.g. technology references) and must each individually comply with the basic document structure for ASAM standards. A base standard defines the syntax, abstract models, and functionality for general use. A base standard is defined in a technology-independent form. It can use a problem-/task-related notation, e.g., UML for an object model, or any suitable description for protocols. Typically, a base standard is A Format description (data structure) or A Protocol definitions or An API and has the following properties: Platform-independent Technology-independent Supplier-independent Does not contradict any other ASAM standard There are platform- and technology-specific mapping rules for each base standard. These are defined in Technology reference as independent parts of the base standard. An associated standard always refers to a base standard. These are examples of associated standards: Application area companion Transport layer specification The content characterization indicates the type of the part of the standard. These are: Format description API Protocol definitions Technology reference Application area companion Transport layer specification. A \"set of standards\" is a special form comprising different elements in one standard. A format description standard defines the syntax and semantics of a file format to exchange data. Currently these standards are defined in XML, but older standards, such as ASAM MCD-2 MC (ASAP2), still use proprietary ASCII formats. There are also binary description standards, for example, to store measurement data efficiently. An application programming interface (API) is the interface that a computer system, library or application provides in order to allow requests for service to be made of it by other com-puter programs, and/or to allow data to be exchanged between them. An API allows software components to communicate with one another. A protocol definition defines the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication. A communications protocol is a system of digital message formats and rules for exchanging the messages in or between computer systems. A protocol may have a formal description. A technology reference specifies the technology-dependent interpretation of the generic standard as mapping rules. If these mapping rules are complied with, the deliverables are technology-specific implementations of standards that are suitable for a specific implemen-tation platform and native programming languages. These technology references are typically available for base standards and companion standards. An application area companion is an associated extension of a base standard for a specific type of device or a specific application area. A companion uses the syntax and the abstract models of the base standard. Companion standards describe models for application fields (application-specific information) and are technology-independent. A transport layer specification details, for example, how a generic protocol definition is to be interpreted using a concrete physical layer. The transport layer provides uniform access to the application-oriented layers, so that the application-oriented layers do not have to take the properties of the communication network into account. ASAM provides a template for creating an ASAM specification, including a description of use and illustrated by examples. The style sheet defines an identical look & feel for all ASAM standards. The main definitions are for the headers and footers, and for the cover page and directories. Rules for designing graphics, tables, source text, headings, etc. are included. The cover page uses field functions that can be modified via the document properties. Figure 1. Cover page properties The official name is used for classification and is also used qualitatively in the portfolio and the Standards Collection (SVN), and on the ASAM website. The official name typically be-gins with ASAM, and the actual name of the standard. The standard name matches the subarea used in the logical structure of the SVN and the ASAM website. The market name can also be added in round parentheses. The descriptive title typically explains the abbreviations used in the official name. The descriptive title is identical for all the standards of a (sub)area. There is a base standard and 0 to N associated standards for each subarea. A standard can itself consist of several parts. It is subdivided to indicate which independent documents belong together within the standard. The name of a part or the name of the associated standard is used as the document name. Figure 2. Cover page of ASAM standards The version always relates to the current document and not to the standard designation in the descriptive title. This means that all the parts of a standard and all associated standards can have their own versions. The ASAM portfolio lists only the base standards and the associated standards, but not independent parts. Technical specifications in the base standard use the document name \"Programmers' Guide\", and documents describing an API that is available as a model use the document name \"Programmers' Reference Guide\". Technology references form parts and are not associated standards, but the portfolio does name them separately as available add-ons.

A standard package consists of at least one base standard. Other deliverable items, as listed on this page, are optional. A base standard contains all fundamental specifications such as abstract object models, syntax definitions and functional behavior descriptions. It uses a problem- or task-oriented notation, such as UML or BNF. A base standard is technology- and implementation-independent. Each ASAM standard consists of one base standard document. Some base standards at ASAM are split-up into two documents, which is the Reference Guide, which contains all formal specifications of the standard in a reference-book style, and the User’s Guide, which further specifies the application of the standard. All other standard documents within a standard package are associated to the base standard, and are of one of the following types: Companion standard The notion of companion standard is typically used for application- or device-specific extensions of a base standard. Technology reference Technology references map the abstract specifications of the base standard to specific technologies, e.g. programming langages or data-base implementations. Transport Layer Specification Transport layer specifications are similar to technology references, as they also provide a technology mapping. The notion of transport layer specification is used in the area of communication technologies. They provide a mapping of the base standard to specific protocol- or bus-technologies. The transport layer abstracts access of higher application layers to the lower layers of the communication system. Model files typically contain the object model of the standard. A typical example of a model file in ASAM standards are UML models created with the tool \"Enterprise Architect\" (.ea). Schema files define the formal structure and syntax of text files. They are used for automated schema validation. Typical examples of schema files are XML definition files (.xsd) or Google protocol buffers definition files (.proto). Interface definition files define programmatic interfaces, such as APIs (Application Programming Interface). They are used for automatic code generation of the standardized interface for specific programming languages. A typical example of an interface definition file is the Interface Description Language file (.idl). Example files demonstrate a typical and standard-compliant implementation of the standard.","title":"ASAM Deliverables","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"","name":"deliverables","url":"/asamprojectguide/standardization/deliverables.html","titles":[{"text":"Standard documents","hash":"_standard_documents","id":1},{"text":"Base standard","hash":"_base_standard","id":2},{"text":"Other files","hash":"_other_files","id":3},{"text":"Model files","hash":"_model_files","id":4},{"text":"Schema files","hash":"_schema_files","id":5},{"text":"Interface definition files","hash":"_interface_definition_files","id":6},{"text":"Example files","hash":"_example_files","id":7}]},"258":{"id":258,"text":"The purpose of the Development phase is to create a new version of the standard. asam development process Development Figure 1. The Development Phase (simplified) Figure 2. PLACEHOLDER - Project setup Purpose To develop a new version of a standard or a new standard. Responsible Project group Involved TSC, Office The governing documents, which shall be considered during the Development phase of the project, are: the Project Guide (this document). the project proposal. The project leader is responsible that the project is managed in compliance with the documents. Each project member shall be aware of the content of the documents. The project group has the additional task to review all open or incoming change requests (CR) and decide, whether they shall be resolved, declined or deferred to a later project. Upon technical release of the new standard, no CR shall be in an unviewed and undecided status. ASAM work groups are given a lot of latitude to organize their work during the Development phase of the project. Project groups can determine their own rules, processes and formats how to conduct meetings and how to carry out their work. ASAM requires a minimum of rules to be followed: each project must have an elected project leader each meeting is documented via minutes members need to use the ASAM IT infrastructure standards are written by using the ASAM document template for standards the working language is English The Office will provisionally lead the project until the group has elected the project leader. Upon request, the Office provides training to the project group members about ASAM guidelines and best practices. Furthermore, the Office assists the project leader upon his request to manage the meetings during the initial meetings. The ASAM IT infrastructure provides services for collaboration such as a version control system for documents and files, a change request tracking system and remote conferencing. The use of alternative IT services requires the approval from the ASAM Office. Individual project group members have the primary task to make their expertise and committed work time available for the development of the standard. This specifically means: provide use-cases, application & process knowledge and requirements as a foundation for developing the standard potentially submit company-IP for ASAM standardization provide expertise on technical details vote on the acceptance of individual proposals and the release candidate potentially write parts of the standard or contribute to other works of authorship use, control and review the work of service providers review the work of other authors The project leader is the elected manager and representative of the project group. They have the following tasks: invite members to the next meeting(s) determine the meeting agenda moderate project group meetings writes the meeting minutes manage the service provider(s) coordinate the standard authors (if there is more than one) represent the group towards the TSC, Office and ASAM members is responsible for the work group’s progress and the final deliverables to ASAM collect measures regarding project status and report the project status to the TSC The project leader can delegate some of the tasks to project members or service providers. However, they cannot delegate responsibilities. They remain the responsible person for each task listed above. Each meeting has a host. Typically, meetings are hosted by a different project group member at each meeting. The tasks of the host are: provide meeting room and catering provide Internet connection, a speaker phone and video conferencing, as required The ASAM Office takes over the role of meeting host, if video conferencing has been requested and budgeted as per approved project proposal. Project groups can have one or multiple service provider(s). They are being paid from the approved project budget. Their services may comprise, but are not limited to: authoring the standard create other work artefacts, e.g. UML models, schemas, interface description files, examples, etc. prepare technical content of meetings develop prototypes, tools or software as part of the standard create the deliverables to ASAM A service provider can take over some of the tasks of the project leader. Service providers and the project leader must originate from different companies. The group shall strive to make all decisions in consensus. If this seems impossible in certain situations, then the project leader may call for a vote on a specific topic. The meeting minutes shall clearly describe, what the members are voting on. Each company has one vote. At least 50% of all companies, which participate in the project, must cast their vote for the voting result to be valid. Project group members can cast their votes up to five work days after the publication of the meeting minutes. Votes cannot be transferred to other companies. A decision is made by absolute majority. New companies may join the group after the beginning of the Development phase. Requests for new admissions are directed to the project leader. They bring the request into the next group meeting. New admissions are accepted by absolute majority of the group members. Admission of new member companies shall be an exception and shall be handled with more restraint the more the project has advanced. During the duration of the project, the project’s progress is controlled by the TSC. Project controlling is carried out according to the following process: The project leader submits a controlling report four weeks prior to the next TSC meeting. TSC members review the written project report prior to the TSC_ meeting. The TSC_ meeting organizer creates a project list that includes the date of the last report of the project given to the _TSC. The project is put on the TSC agenda, if either the project leader or a TSC member request a live report. The TSC may draw its conclusions from the report. If a project does not work as expected, the TSC may decide on corrective actions. The project leader can propose to the TSC to expel a member from the work group. One reason for expulsion can be, that a work group member has continually failed to meet his commitments, e.g. to participate at work group meetings. The project leader shall provide justification and evidence for his proposal. The TSC then votes on the expulsion of the member.

If a standard has a known problem, then members generally have the expectation that the known problem is fixed within a reasonable time. Buyers of ASAM standards have, in accordance with the German civil code BGB, the right of supplementary performance (ger. Nacherfüllung) if the standard has a known problem. The issue resolution process shall ensure that member expectations are met and the legal rights of buyers are fulfilled within a predictable period of time and for all standards. This process is limited to resolve technical issues of ASAM standards. Issues in the context of this process have one of the following characteristics: Error: unintended or wrong content. Contradiction: inconsistent or contradictory content. Specification gap: missing content required for a functional system and for com-plete understanding. Lack of clarity: Unclear, vague or ambiguous description, which leads to misun-derstandings and misinterpretations. The issue may exist in the base standard, in associate standards, schema files, interface definition files, model files, examples or any other supplements of the standard. The request of a new feature or modification of an existing feature, independent of its declared urgency and importance, is not an issue handled through this process. Several parties are involved in carrying out the issue resolution process. A user of an ASAM standard (member or buyer) contacts ASAM technical support with a support request. They may suspect or report an issue with the standard. Typically, the user asks for a clarification on the reported issue and expects an answer that allows him to proceed with his work. They may also demand a fix of the issue. Each ASAM standard has an appointed Standard Manager. They manage the issue resolution process for the standard that they are appointed to. Their primary goals are to resolve known issues of the standard, carrying out all work necessary for implementing the fix and to keep the work load for the members of the Standard Expert Group as low as possible. Their primary tasks are: Handling of support requests on 2nd-level. Handling and monitoring of change requests (CRs). Maintain the public list of known issues (LOKI). Create proposals to resolve those CRs, which are categorized as an issue. Organize and carry out Standard Expert Group meetings. Create revisions of the standard. Obtain technical and public releases of the revised standard. By default, the Standard Manager is a staff member of the ASAM Office. ASAM members can voluntarily take over the role of Standard Manager for a standard. If there are no volunteers available among ASAM members and if the ASAM Office staff is either not qualified or the volume of work would be too high, then the office shall appoint a paid service provider for the job. The minimum tenure for the Standard Manager shall be one year. Each ASAM standard has an Standard Expert Group. The members of the Standard Expert Group have the primary purpose to ensure technical meaningfulness and correctness of revisions to their standard and to provide the necessary legitimacy for the new release to-gether with the TSC (see next sub-chapter). The members of the Standard Expert Group have four primary tasks: Review and confirm reported issues. Advise the Standard Manager on how to fix reported issues of the standard. Review implemented fixes in the revised standard. Vote on the technical release of the revised standard. An optional task of the Standard Expert Group is to review feature requests and initiate next steps, e.g. to create a project proposal. The members of the Standard Expert Groups are volunteers from ASAM member companies. By default, members of the project group, which developed the latest version of the standard, become automatically members of the Standard Expert Group. They shall commit their participation in this group for one year as a minimum. A member can leave the group by notifying ASAM of his intentions not to be part of the group any longer or because they are not working for an ASAM member company any longer. New members can join by absolute majority decision of the current Standard Expert Group members. The work load for the Standard Expert Group members shall be kept to a minimum. Throughout the year, the members of the Standard Expert Group get automatically notified about newly submitted CRs. The group members shall read each CR and optionally cast their veto, if they think that it has been incorrectly categorized as an issue or feature request. All other continuous work is being done by the Standard Manager. Meetings shall preferably be carried out via remote participation (phone + application sharing via Internet). The Standard Expert Group shall consist of at least three members. If the number of mem-bers drops below this limit, then the Standard Manager reports this to the TSC. The TSC decides upon next steps. The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) remains the ultimate authority for making the final release decision. Once a new revision of the standard is ready and got the technical release from the Standard Expert Group, the Standard Manager submits the standard to the TSC. The Release Process is carried out as described in Release Phase. ASAM experiences a continuous and spontaneous influx of support requests for its stand-ards. 1st-Level Support together with the Standard Manager has the overall task to bring structure into this activity and answer the support requests. In case that a support request reveals an issue with an ASAM standard, the following issue resolution process shall be carried out. The process consist of three phases. The time between the reported issue and its resolution through a revised release of the standard shall not exceed 6 months. If the involved parties decide not to resolve the issue, then the process ends in phase 2 and is significantly shorter. If the issue shall be resolved via a new release of the standard, then the outcome of this process can only be a revision release (third digit of the version number). Changes that would render the standard incompatible to earlier versions, introduction of new features or major rework that spans over multiple pages and chapters, cannot be implemented through this process. Phases 2 and 3 of the issue resolution process are suspended during the time, when a project group works on the further development of the standard. During this time, the project group is in charge of handling all reported issues. The Standard Manager will only work on technical support during this period. It is recommended that they are a member of the project group. 1.1 The user of an ASAM standard contacts ASAM technical support with a technical ques-tion or a request. 1.2 First-level support processes the support request. If the first-level supporter identifies a feature request or an issue with the standard, then the request shall be forwarded to the Standard Manager (i.e. 2nd-level support) for further processing. 1.3 The Standard Manager determines, whether the support request shall be entered as a CR in ASAM’s CR database and determines its category as feature request, or issue report. If the CR is of the category \"issue report\", then the Standard Manager creates an entry in the LOKI document, too. They also write an answer for the support request. Members of the Standard Expert Group are automatically notified about each new CR. They may object, if a CR has been incorrectly categorized. 2.1 The Standard Manager carries out the issue resolution phase two times per year at most. For each known issue, the Standard Manager creates a specific proposal how to fix the issue. The proposal is copy-and-paste-ready to be implemented into the standard. 2.2 The Standard Manager calls for a Standard Expert Group meeting. They organize and moderates the meeting. The group reviews each CR categorized as an \"issue report\". They present his proposals for resolution of the issues and receives technical advice from the members of the group. The members of the Standard Expert Group have the final decision authority about how to handle each issue. Besides accepting the proposal of the Standard Manager, the Standard Expert Group can also decide to leave an issue unresolved or to defer the resolution to a standard development project. In both cases, the decision must be well reasoned, and the reason is published in the LOKI. In case of deferring the issue res-olution to a project, a member of the Standard Expert Group must commit to submit a project proposal for this purpose. 2.3 The Standard Manager creates a new revision of the standard based upon the decisions and technical advice from the Standard Expert Group members. 2.4 The Standard Manager sends out the revised standard to the Standard Expert Group members for review. They collect the review feedback and makes necessary changes to the revision version. 2.5 Once the review iterations are finished, the Standard Manager calls the Standard Expert Group members to cast their votes on the technical release of the revised standard. 3.1 The Standard Manager submits the revised standard to the TSC for public release. The release process is the same as described in chapter 1.4 \"Release Phase\". Correction sheets can be published immediately after the technical release from the Standard Expert Group. The TSC confirms in its next meeting the release.","title":"Issue resolution process","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"","name":"issue-resolution","url":"/asamprojectguide/standardization/issue-resolution.html","titles":[{"text":"Scope","hash":"_scope","id":1},{"text":"Roles","hash":"_roles","id":2},{"text":"Standard user","hash":"_standard_user","id":3},{"text":"Standard manager","hash":"_standard_manager","id":4},{"text":"Standard expert group","hash":"_standard_expert_group","id":5},{"text":"TSC","hash":"_tsc","id":6},{"text":"Process","hash":"_process","id":7},{"text":"Phase 1: Technical Support","hash":"_phase_1_technical_support","id":8},{"text":"Phase 2: Issue Resolution","hash":"_phase_2_issue_resolution","id":9},{"text":"Phase 3: Release","hash":"_phase_3_release","id":10}]},"260":{"id":260,"text":"Creating standards at ASAM follows very specific processes.

The participants of the Proposal Workshop shall determine the proposal submitter. The Office is responsible for the preparation and carrying out of the Proposal Workshop. This is done in close cooperation with the member(s), who initiated the process and are the major drivers of the idea. The Office sends out a public invitation for the Proposal Workshop at least four weeks prior to the event with a brief description of the goals and content of the proposed project. The Office informs the TSC. Proposal Workshops are open to all ASAM members. Non-members can participate upon invitation by the Office. By default, the Office moderates the workshop. This task can be passed to a member, if appropriate. If there is significant interest in the proposed project in different regions (primarily in North America, Europe, East Asia), then the Office organizes meetings in a way that equally allows all members from those regions to influence the results of the Proposal Workshop. The results of the Proposal Workshop are documented in meeting minutes, which are sent out to all participants after the meeting. Purpose To create the project proposal. Responsible Proposal submitter Involved Office, members The submitter of a project proposal must be an ASAM member in an \"active\" membership class. The submitter shall consider the following input for writing the project proposal: meeting minutes of the Proposal Workshop (if this occurred) own sources (if no Proposal Workshop occurred) relevant papers from concept projects The submitter shall estimate the work efforts of the project and create a milestone plan. The duration of the plan shall not exceed 1.5 years. The proposal may contain a request for video conferencing support through the Office, if project group members originate from locations that would require long-distance (i.e. inter-continental) business trips to regularly participate at project meetings. The Office assists the submitter by giving advice with respect to ASAM guideline and best practices. The Office checks the proposal document for formal compliance and understandability. The submitter shall send out the proposal to all participants of the Proposal Workshop (if this occurred) for review. Purpose To submit the finalized project proposal to ASAM Responsible Proposal submitter Involved Office The submitter of the project proposal sends the proposal document to the Office and declares this to be his official proposal submission. Besides the submitter, at least two further members must support the proposal and be listed as participants for the proposed project group. Purpose To allow members and the TSC to read and review the project proposal, to clarify open questions and to allow members to enroll for participation in the upcoming project. Responsible Office Involved TSC, members The Office checks the proposal document for formal compliance. Once the document is accepted, the Office checks the document into the TSC file repository, puts the proposal on the ASAM website for download and publishes the proposal via a newsletter- and optional webpage-article. Members are invited to enroll for participation in the upcoming project. The Office manages the registration of project group members during this phase. If a member intends to commit a work effort of less than 50% of the average of the work efforts committed by all other project group members, then the Office can deny the registration. The member or the office can escalate the issue to the TSC. The content of the proposal is not changed during the publication period. An exception are error corrections and the registration of additional project group members. Members of the TSC review the content of the proposal and clarify open questions with the submitter. The minimum publication period for project proposals is four weeks and shall not exceed eight weeks. Purpose To approve or reject the project proposal. Responsible TSC Involved Proposal submitter Submitted project proposals are put on the agenda of the next available TSC meeting. Proposals are handled during the meeting via a three-step process: Submitter presents the proposal to the TSC members. TSC members are given the opportunity to ask questions. TSC members discuss the proposal (without submitter’s presence) and then proceed with casting their votes on the proposal. The TSC does not modify the content of the proposal. If this is deemed to be necessary, then the proposal shall be rejected. The TSC may add constraints or conditions for the execution of the proposed project. They are noted in the meeting minutes. The TSC may decide to approve only some of the defined work packages of the project and ask for re-submission of the proposal with a content update for the unapproved work packages. The TSC might assign a mentor for each new standard or major version development project. The mentor shall be a member of the TSC. The voting is carried out in accordance with the TSC voting rules. The Board Representative for the TSC_ has to confirm the _TSC decision. The proposed project becomes effective with the given approval of both parties.

The Review Phase (simplified) Purpose To create a preliminary version of the standard for carrying out a public review. Responsible Project group Involved none The draft standard shall be feature-complete, i.e. the specification or revision of all features of the standard has been finished. The project group members determine, whether the standard is ready for public review. The project leader is responsible for delivering the draft document(s) in a format, which is usable in the ASAM IT-infrastructure for document reviews. Changes to the prior version shall be marked in the draft documents or documented in a separate change log with clear references to the draft documents. Purpose To obtain technical review feedback from members. Responsible Office Involved Members, project group The Office publishes the start of the public review process via newsletter and ASAM website, and provides additional information, such as a brief description of the changes in the standard, review process steps and the review deadline. The Office provides an IT-solution for carrying out the public draft review. The Office provides technical support for reviewers and ensures that review feedback is accessible to the project group members in a timely manner. In general, every ASAM member can download the draft standard and participate in the review. The Office may restrict the group of reviewers in agreement with the project group members or as per TSC decision. Members of the project group are available to answer technical questions from reviewers. Reviewers shall not submit new use-cases, features or requirements as part of their review feedback. The Office asks the reviewers to submit such requests via the regular ASAM CR system. The minimum review period for a new standard is 8 weeks and shall not exceed 16 weeks. The minimum review period for a major version is 6 weeks and shall not exceed 12 weeks. Purpose To end the public review and have all feedback ready for the next process step. Responsible Office Involved none The Office terminates the public draft review process by: removing the draft standard download from the ASAM website. closing the IT-solution to accept further review feedback. Purpose To review and decide upon the reviewers' feedback and to incorporate corresponding changes to the draft standard. Responsible Project group Involved Members The project group has the obligation to review each review feedback and make a decision on how to further work on it. The decision includes as a minimum the status \"accepted\", \"rejected\" or \"deferred\". The decision must be documented. Accepted feedback shall be implemented. The project group has full authority how to implement the reviewers' feedback into the standard. They can implement changes as proposed by the reviewer, or decide for a different implementation. If a reviewer’s feedback is actually out-of-scope, since it contains a request to consider a new use-case, feature or requirement, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the ASAM CR-system with status \"new\". ASAM has the obligation to inform reviewers about the status of their review feedback, upon their request.

The DCO is an attestation attached to every contribution made by every developer. In the commit message of the contribution, (described more fully later in this document), the developer simply adds a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO. When a developer submits a patch, it is a commitment that the contributor has the right to submit the patch per the standard license. The DCO agreement is shown below and online. Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 By making a contribution to this project, I certify that: (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as Indicated in the file; or (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it. (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved. The DCO requires a sign-off message in the following format appear on each commit in the pull request: Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname The DCO text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either -s or --signoff to your usual Git commit commands. If you forget to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit with the sign-off by running git commit --amend -s. You can add sign-offs to multiple commits (including commits originally authored by others, if you are authorized to do so) using git rebase --signoff. If you’ve pushed your changes to GitHub already you’ll need to force push your branch after this with git push --force-with-lease. If you want to be reminded to add the sign-off for commits in your repository, you can add the following commit-message git hook to your repository: #!/bin/sh # = Check for dCO/Signed-off-by in message # if ! grep -q \"^Signed-off-by: \" \"$1\" then echo \"Aborting commit: Commit message is not signed off\" >&2 exit 1 fi Placing this script into a file called .git/hooks/commit-msg and making it executable (e.g. using chmod a+x .git/hooks/commit-msg on unixoid operating systems) will prevent commits that do not have a sign-off.

The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority. Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority. In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down Ask a member or the service provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic. In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on.

AsciiDoc is a mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more. You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a normal text document. There are no markup tags or weird format notations. AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or translated to other presentation formats. See Writing guide for ASAM-specific writing style requirements. ASAM uses .adoc as fileextension for all AsciiDoc files. Main advantages: Can be edited in any text editor or using the online editor in GitLab Focus on content, not on formatting! Versionable and diffable – i.e. we can tell who did what, when and where! In the end we can deliver an interactive html instead of a static pdf The content of this page is intended to provide a quick overview of the most-used features of the language. See the links below for more detail Quick reference User manual For general information on how to write and format AsciiDoc content, see the official Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference. Besides the general syntax, ASAM standards follow ASAM guidelines as well. These are listed below. For most cases, Draw.io shall be used.

Use each of these sparingly. You don’t want to create pages that are full of notes and tips. They become less meaningful if you do. Here’s what each of these looks like when the AsciiDoc content is turned into HTML: This is a note. It includes extra info that a reader might need to know. Here’s a tip. A tip provides useful information that can help a user do something or understand something. This is important information that the reader must be aware of so they don’t do something that they shouldn’t. A caution advises the reader to act carefully. Use this in rare circumstances. And this is a warning that informs of danger or harm. This one should be used very rarely, as well. If you’re authoring new content, you’ll want to review this section for some nitty-gritty details. If you’re explaining how to perform a task, you might include introductory information before you get to the steps. And you might need to say what to do after completing the steps. If you do, it’s best to organize that information using headers, which enables scanning. Use the following headings as needed: What you’ll need The information the user needs to complete the task. About this task Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task. Steps The individual steps to complete the task. What’s next? What the user should do next. Each of these should include a . right before the text, like so: .What you'll need .About this task .Steps .What's next? This syntax applies bold text in a larger font.

This guide focuses on uniform formatting and naming for source code. It does neither contain best-practices nor is it a reference for the language. You should follow the recommendations in this document in the following cases: You are a scenario developer writing fully functional scenarios for real use. You are a writer of documentation and want to add code examples (snippets) to your adoc document. In this case you should mark your code examples as a [source, osc2] source block as described in the Writing guide. By following the recommendations in this guide your code becomes easy-to-understand for you and other users. Use four space characters per indentation level. Do not use tab characters. Use the following text editor settings: Tab size: 4 Insert spaces For support in Visual Studio Code, see Indentations. Use UTF-8 as encoding. For support in Visual Studio Code, see Automatic Whitespace Removal. Whitespace characters provide better readability when used in the correct places. Use only space characters as whitespace. Replace tabs with four spaces as described in Indentation. The correct use of space characters within osc2 source code is as follows: One space after a comma (, in argument lists and other lists) One space after a colon (for example, for inheritance) One space before and after a keyword One space before and after an operator No spaces before and after brackets and braces (for example, in function calls or for indexing) No space between value and unit The following code snippet shows some examples of the correct use of space characters. Correct use of space characters func(arg[1], arg2) if x == 4: print x, y foo == [x, y, z] func(1) abc[key] = lst[index] i = i + 1 actor bus: car(category: bus): keep(width == 1.8m) keep(length == 4.5m) swerve_story: serial: side_vehicle.drive() with: path(s_side_vehicle) keep_speed() with: until (top.time > 5sec) Single lines of comments and inline comments can be added using 'pound' symbol (#). # This is a single line comment. i = i + 42 # This is an inline comment Blocks of comments can be simulated by using several single lines of comments. # This is a block of comments example. # The following call to foo is commented out # Reason: see issue xyz # More explanation here... # # foo() Consider breaking up statements that are too long to fit into one line. Use the line continuation special character 'backslash' (\\) for marking the continuation. This is a line of text that is too long for a single \\ line, so continue after the backslash in a new line. Naming conventions are a widely discussed topic with great influence on readability influenced by fashion changes, habit and personal taste. Here are the recommendations valid for naming conventions in OpenSCENARIO 2.x source code. The naming style is not finally decided. Use Use snake_case only until further notice! Use snake_case (aka lowercase_with_underscore) for all source code elements that are not keywords. Example for correctly formatted code # 1: Define an actor actor car_group: average_distance: length number_of_cars: uint # 2: Define a road element struct struct geometric_road: road_element: min_radius: length max_radius: length side: av_side # 3: Define a scenario scenario dut.traverse_junction_at_yield: s: road_with_sign with(sign_type: yield) do dut.car.traverse_junction() with: ... # 4: Define a containing scenario scenario dut.mix_three_dangers: weather_kind: weather_kind keep(weather_kind != clear) do mix: cut_in_and_slow() traverse_junction_at_yield() weather(kind: weather_kind) Do not use the following characters as single character names because they can be easily misread as zero (0) or one (1): No single lowercase 'el' (l) No single uppercase 'eye' (I) No single lowercase 'oh' (o) No single uppercase 'oh' (O) Here is a more complex example showing all the rules. Example for correctly formatted code in OpenSCENARIO 2.x scenario slower_large_vehicle_in_adjacent_lane ego_vehicle: vehicle with: keep(p_vehicle_model == APTIV_ego_vehicle) v1: vehicle with: keep(vehicle_category == Bus) keep(p_vehicle_model == BlueBird_Vision_2014) keep(p_vehicle_model.Color == Blue) ego_model: ego_vehicle.p_vehicle_model ego_route: ego_vehicle.route v1_model: v1.p_vehicle_model v1_route: v1.route ego_start_speed: speed ego_start_distance: length v1_start_speed: speed v1_start_distance: length simulation_platform_choice: string simulation_time_threshold_reached: time ego_ttc_threshold: time ego_distance_to_bias: length lane_choice: string ego_lane: lane map: file_path keep(map == \"/maps/example.xodr\") simple_3_lane_road_01: lane_section lane1^: lane lane2^: lane lane3^: lane simple_3_lane_road_01.lanes = [lane1^, lane2^, lane3^] keep(simple_2_lane_road_01 == map.road(id:\"1\").*lane_section(s:\"0\")) lane3^ = rightmost_lane(map.*right) keep(lane2^ -[:LEFT_OF]-> lane3^) keep(lane1^ -[:LEFT_OF]-> lane2^) # Logic Parameter Syntax keep(ego_lane in: { if: lane_choice == \"Left\" THEN: SET ego_lane = \"lane1^\", if: lane_choice == \"Right\" THEN: SET ego_lane = \"lane3^\"}) keep(ego_model == APTIV_ego_vehicle) keep(ego_route == ego_drive_left) keep(v1_model == BlueBird_Vision_2014) keep(v1_route == v1_drive) keep(ego_start_speed == 80.46719999999999 [kph]) keep(ego_start_distance == 5 [m]) keep(v1_start_speed == 48.28032 [kph]) keep(v1_start_distance == 55.0 [m]) keep(simulation_platform_choice == \"CarMaker\") keep(simulation_time_threshold_reached == 120 [s]) keep(ego_ttc_threshold == 1 [s]) keep(ego_distance_to_bias == 1 [m]) keep(lane_choice == \"Left\") # Relationship Syntax keep(v1_start_speed -[:SLOWER_THAN]-> ego_start_speed) def distance_between_ego_vehicle_and_v1(vehicle, vehicle) -> length is external \"kpi.py\" def get_ttc_with_vehicle_to_vehicle(vehicle, vehicle, string) -> time is external \"kpi_TTC.py\" !ego_speed: speed = ego_vehicle.speed !ego_end_of_road: Position = ego_vehicle.end_of_road !ego_off_road: Position = ego_vehicle.off_road !simulation_time: time = simulation.time !ego_vehicle_lane: lane = ego_vehicle.lane !ego_collision_monitor: integer = sensor.collision.v.fr1.count !ego_ttc_with_v1: time = sample(ego_vehicle.get_ttc_with_vehicle_to_vehicle(ego_vehicle:vehicle, v1:vehicle, [simulation_platform_choice])) !ego_distance_to_v1: length = sample(distance_between_egoVehicle_and_v1(v1:vehicle, ego_vehicle:vehicle, [simulation_platform_choice])) event observation_complete is(one_of(@end_conditions)) event ego_ttc_threshold_reached1 is(!ego_ttc_with_v1 0) event end_conditions[2] is(!ego_off_road > 0) event end_conditions[3] is(!simulation_time > [simulation_time_threshold_reached]) event end_conditions[4] is(!ego_collision_monitor > 0) event end_conditions[5] is((ego_vehicle.s_road - v1.s_road) > 40) do parallel(): ego_init_drive_01: ego_vehicle.drive(ego_route) with: position(at_distance: ego_start_distance, beyond_start_of: ego_route) speed(at_speed: ego_start_speed) at(at:start) v1_init_drive_01: v1.drive(v1_route) with: position(at_distance: v1_start_distance, ahead_of: ego_vehicle) speed(at_speed: v1_start_speed) at(at:start) until(@observation_complete) If you cannot find a recommendation for your source code formatting or naming problem in this document, follow the Style Guide for Python Code (PEP 8).

In the ASAM Editorial Guide, editorial rules exist. workgroup members and technical writers shall apply the rules when creating documentation for ASAM. This section contains information on how to create and apply editorial rules. Provide the ASAM Editorial Guide to workgroup members and technical writers when a project starts. workgroup members should try to apply the editorial rules. Technical writers may educate workgroup members who do not apply the editorial rules. Technical writers shall review the content committed by workgroup members as soon as possible. When creating documentation for ASAM, the following approach is applicable: Check if an appropriate editorial rule exists in the ASAM Editorial Guide when creating documentation. If an editorial rule exists, apply the rule to the documentation. If no editorial rule exists, create a new rule. In the list of editorial rules, each rule can be assigned one of the following three status tags: Status tag Description draft The draft tag is assigned to editorial rules that have been created and are not approved yet. approved The approved tag is assigned to editorial rules the OpenX team agreed on and that shall be applied when crating documentation for ASAM. rejected The rejected tag is assigned to editorial rules the OpenX team did not agree on and that shall not be applied when crating documentation for ASAM. Start the process of creating new editorial rules when an error in the documentation becomes obvious, for example, when sentences in lists sometimes end with a period and sometimes not. The rules.csv file contains a list of all editorial rules. Create a rule ID in rules.csv file if no rule exists. Tag the created editorial rule in the rules.csv file as draft. Example ID,Short_Description,Link_to_Project_Guide,Link_to_Test,Status ASM-1,No fixed versioning,-,-,draft Column Description ID Assign a new unique identifier following the convention ASM-[number], for example, ASM-1. Short_Description Add a short description that explains the subject of the editorial rule. Link_to_Project_Guide Add a link to the section in the ASAM Editorial Guide that contains information on the editorial rule. Link_to_Test Add a link to the file that contains the automatic test. Status Assign the status for a new editorial rule, for example, draft. This section contains information on how to add an editorial rule Create a new section in the ASAM Editorial Guide. Add a tag to the section following the convention [#sec-[ID]], for example, [#sec-ASM-2]. Brainstorm how to document the specific editorial rule. Have a look at existing resources: Check if an editorial rule exists in the ASD-STE100 Specification (Simplified Technical English). Check if an editorial rule exists in the Google developer documentation style guide and the Microsoft Writing Style Guide. Extract useful editorial rules from the existing resources. Adjust the wording in editorial rules when transferring rules to the ASAM Editorial Guide, for example, Microsoft names subunits of a list items, that are named elements at ASAM. Draft the section for the editorial rule in the ASAM Editorial Guide. Have a look if an automatic test exists, for example, for Vale. Add a link to the section of the editorial rule and, if applicable, a link the file for the automatic test to the rules.csv file. Information architecture for editorial rules Content Example Use Section anchor [#sec-ASM-2] Required Heading with rule ID in brackets Start headings with a capital letter (ASM-2) Required Short description Optional One or more instructions Optional One or more negative and positive examples Required One or more exceptions when an editorial rule does not apply Optional One or more sources for the justification of the rule Required Potential for automatic checking, for example with link on vale rule Optional","title":"Documentation processes","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"","name":"documentation_processes","url":"/asamprojectguide/compendium/writing_guidelines/documentation_processes.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

These adoc-comments are used by the UML2adoc script to generate documentation fragments. Only use multi-line comments /'adoc …​ '/ for adoc-comments that shall appear in the adoc fragment! (Single-line comments '…​ can still be used for commenting out parts of the plantuml or for comments that shall not appear in the adoc fragment) Put adoc-comments inside the element-body {}. Put adoc-comments after the element the comment belongs to. Please do not use standard apostrophes (') inside your comment as this is the comment marker used by plantuml. Use quotation marks (\") or acute accents (´) instead. A standard adoc-documentation of an element. The appears as a comment in a value/comment-table. This type is useful to describe enum values and other elements without a special adoc-documentation tag. Example enum Example_enum { First_value /'adoc Documentation for \"first value\" '/ Second_value /'adoc Documentation for \"second value\" '/ } Used to document the basic qualities of a class. Put the followed by a colon (without space), followed by a space, followed by the documentation . The following keywords are supported: instantiable Yes for normal entities, no for abstract entities. parent You may add a parent manually here. Parents are also automatically deduced from the uml file. description A description of the entity. controlled_states Action-specific information about controlled states. action_ending Action-specific information about when exactly an action ends. action_actors Action-specific information about which actors use the action. include Path to an adoc-fragment. If found, this fragment is added at the end of the description text before the basic information table. Use this option for more sophisitcated text formatting with paragraphs, lists and pictures. Works best with paths relative to the adoc-output directory. examples Path to an adoc-fragment with examples. If found, this fragment is added after the description tables. Works best with paths relative to the adoc-output directory. implementation Path to an adoc-fragment with implementation details. If found, this fragment is added after the description tables. Works best with paths relative to the adoc-output directory. The information forms the basic information table in the fragment. Information about inheritance, composition, aggregation and connection is automatically retrieved. Example 1. Basic comments class child_class { /'adoc-basic instantiable: no'/ /'adoc-basic parent: parent_class '/ /'adoc-basic description: This is the child class. '/ /'adoc-basic controlled-states: Any state. '/ /'adoc-basic action_ending: Ends when actor reaches destination.

Example 3. State comments class another_class { /'adoc-state speed: double;1..1;The speed '/ /'adoc-state position: double;1..1;The position '/ } Used to mark an entry, usually a function as a method. Fragment with detailed description, like return value and arguments. Example 4. Method comments class yet_another_class { do_something() /'adoc-method ./path/to/fragment/thing_do_something.adoc '/ } Used to mark an entry, usually a function, as a modifier. Fragment with detailed description, like description and parameters. Example 5. Modifier comments class and_another_class { modify_xy() /'adoc-modifier ./path/to/fragment/thing_modify_xy.adoc '/ } Follow these steps to add documentation: Add adoc-comments to plantuml files. Commit and push plantuml files to gitlab. The pipeline then runs the script and adoc fragments are created automatically. If you want to exclude a uml-file from being analyzed, insert /'adoc-fileignore'/ at the beginning of the uml-file. Example 6. Exculding files @startuml foo /'adoc-fileignore'/ class bar { ... } @enduml If you want to check the content of the created fragments, you can download them as a pipeline artifact. Depending on which Gitlab page you are using you can find the artifacts at different places. Use the download button on the pipeline continuous integration page. Figure 1. Download option on CI page Use the download option on the page of the merge request. Figure 2. Download option on MR page Once the fragments are available in the pipeline you can use the anchors to link to specific parts or you can include the fragments in your adoc documents. Use the following link syntax in your document to link to details in the fragment: > A link to the anchor 'the-uid-of-the-fragment-detail' is created. The uid of the fragment is [#top---] The uid of the table with basic information is [#tab----basics] The uid of the table with standard and property information is [#tab----info] The uid of the table with state information is [#tab----states] You can make the adoc-fragment part of your adoc-topic by including it using the following syntax: include::./path/to/fragments/fragment_name.adoc[] This way the whole fragment appears as if it was copied into your topic.

It provides you a set of hints and rules that make it easier to contribute concise and homogeneous content and documents to the projects. If you are using VSCode, see the ASAM recommended Visual Studio Code settings. Use \"English (US)\" (ISO: en-US) as a language setting in your text editor. Mnemonic: -or, -l, -yze, -er Table 1. American English No Yes colour color labelling labeling analyse analyze centre center Use these modal verbs to express the level of obligation: Table 2. Proper modal verbs Level of obligation Verb to use Colloquial meaning Requirement shall, shall not mandatory statement, \"it must do/have\", \"it is not allowed to do/have\" Recommendation should, should not \"it is good/bad practice to do/have\" Permission may, need not \"it is allowed to do/have and also allowed not to do/have\" Possibility can, cannot \"it depends on some circumstances if or if not\" The differences between these verbs are subtle and sometimes difficult to grasp. The table with modal verbs is based on ISO guidelines but currently under discussion. It is possible that the table will be simplified in the future. Write short sentences. If sentences get too long, consider splitting them up into shorter sentences. Keep headings short (only one line). Table 3. Shortness is key No Yes 3.1 Hints on how to maintain the printer 3.1 Printer maintenance Due to the fact that they were able to come to an agreement, a name changing of the file took place. The file was renamed. Present tense is easy to understand. Present tense is the preferred tense to express technical facts. Table 4. Present tense No Yes Chapter X will describe the details.

After hitting the button, the pop-up appears. Press the key. After pressing the key, a pop-up appears. Do not use words like \"basically\", \"actually\", \"very\", \"practically\", …​ Use 'that' and 'which' to express the information level: 'that' adds essential information, no commas are used. 'which' adds information that can be left out, commas are used. Table 9. Precision matters No Yes The rule I follow The rule that I follow The vehicle that is red drives down the road. The vehicle, which is red, drives down the road. Stick to one spelling for a word that allows several spellings (e-mail, email, E-mail). Stick to one style to present information (steps always as numbered lists). Stick to one formatting for a special purpose (first use of technical term: italic) Adoc-templates are available for common types of topics. Use them to create consistent content. Each template contains instructions on how to use the template and sample text that has to be replaced. Currently available templates: Generic Task UML element Use case Insert a line break after each sentence. No manual line breaks inside sentences. ⇒ \"Only hit 'enter' after a period ('.'), but make sure to hit 'enter' after a period.\" 1 This is the first sentence. 2 This is the second sentence. 3 This is the third sentence. Use paragraphs to structure your text. A new thought or statement requires a new paragraph. An empty line creates a new paragraph. 1 This is the first sentence of the first paragraph. 2 This is the second sentence of the first paragraph. 3 4 This is the first sentence of the second paragraph. In headings and captions, only the first word begins with an uppercase letter (sentence-style capitalization). Exception: Acronyms and proper names are spelled as is. Table 10. Use of uppercase in headings and captions No Yes Wrong Formatting of a Heading Correct formatting of a heading Asam rules to follow ASAM rules to follow Scope of OpenScenario Scope of OpenSCENARIO Use only lowercase for file and folder names. Use the underscore _ instead of 'space' in file and folder names. Use .adoc as file ending for documents. Table 11. Use of uppercase and underscores in file and folder names No Yes ExampleFileName.adoc example_file_name.adoc Another file name.adoc another_file_name.adoc Writing_guide.adoc writing_guide.adoc Use four space characters per indentation level. Do not use tab characters. Use the following text editor settings: Tab size: 4 Insert spaces Table 12. Four spaces indentation (spaces marked as '.') No Yes Normal text →Level 1 indented text →→Level 2 indented text Normal text …​.Level 1 indented text …​…​..Level 2 indented text All topics, figures, tables and code examples shall have a unique tag. Sections may also have a tag if a link to the section is needed. Note: If you cannot come up with a document-wide unique id, just add [#tag-uid]. This triggers a pipeline warning and the technical writer can help you. Examples: [#top-uid] [#fig-uid] [#tab-uid] [#code-uid] [#sec-uid] You can generate a UUID using a generator like https://www.uuidgenerator.net/. Text sections (paragraphs or blocks of text) in the documentation of a standard are considered normative. If some text sections should be considered as non-normative and only descriptive (for example, background information or examples), mark this sections deliberately as non-normative. Non-normative sections shall be marked with the user-defined asciidoc role non-normative. Put the role attribute [.non-normative] in front of single paragraphs or blocks to mark them as non-normative. Inside a normative section use [.non-normative]## to mark single text passages as non-normative. Example for normative and non-normative sections This is a normative paragraph. [.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph. ==== This is a normative block. ==== [.non-normative] ==== This is a descriptive block. ==== This is another normative paragraph. This sentence is normative. [.non-normative]#This sentence is non-normative.# This sentence is normative again. Roles can be combined using the following syntax: [..]. Example with multiple roles [.important.non-normative] This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph that is also marked with the important-role. Id and role attributes can be combined. Use the long notation for easier reading: [id=, role=]. Example with role and id combined [id=top-doc-unique-id, role=non-normative] = Document title This is a descriptive, non-normative document. The actual format and style of non-normative sections depends on the entry in the CSS style sheet file that is used for rendering the text and is not coded in the adoc-file itself. Example of a CSS entry for non-normative text .non-normative { font-style: italic; color: darkgreen; background: gold } Lists are a great way to present lots of similar information in a compact form. Use the same word/sentence structure for all list items. Use numbered lists (Asciidoc '.') for steps that require a specific order. Use bullet points (Asciidoc '*') for enumerations and elements that do not require a specific order. A numbered list example . First step . Second step . Third step First step Second step Third step Table 13. Bullet point list example 'ingredients' No Yes first 2 apples, then one banana. And you need an orange too! two apples one banana one orange Figures, like pictures or drawings, may be used to illustrate complex facts. Preferred format: .svg Figures are stored in a subfolder named images located inside the chapter folder. Each figure shall have: a tag a caption the link to the picture an alternative text [#fig-uuid] .This is the caption of the figure image::logo.png[an alternative text] Figure 1. This is the caption of the figure Use tables if you have to present a huge amount of similar data in a very compressed form. A table shall have: a tag a caption [#tab-uuid] .This is the caption of the table |=== |cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3 |cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3 |cell 3_1 | cell 3_2 | cell 3_3 |=== Table 14. This is the caption of the table cell 1_1 cell 1_2 cell 1_3 cell 2_1 cell 2_2 cell 2_3 cell 3_1 cell 3_2 cell 3_3 Sometimes you may need to display a character that is reserved for adoc-formatting. Here is how to do it. Underscore (_) Use _ to display an underscore. Pound sign (#) Use # to display a pound sign. Protected space ( ) Use {nbsp} to define a space character is not used for automatic line breaks. This is especially useful for value-unit-pairs like 5{nbsp}m/s (5 m/s) to ensure that value and unit are always in the same line of text. Consider one of the following possibilities if you want to add source code examples to an adoc topic. You may use small bits of code as an inline literal directly inside your text. You may add source code as a fragment from a source code file by reference. You may copy and paste source code directly as a snippet into the adoc topic. For very small bits of code using inline literals is the most convenient way to add source code examples. This type of including source code is especially useful if you want to highlight single code elements like methods or class names. Enclose the source code in a pair of pluses surrounded by a pair of backticks, like this: Call the `+source_example_func()+` for the result. The previous line looks like this as adoc output: Call the source_example_func() for the result. You can add source code as a fragment from a source code file if you would like to reference to the source code within the source code file. There are several advantages of using fragments: You do not need to copy the source code into the documentation. You are referencing to the single point of truth, which is the source code file. If you apply changes to the source code file, these changes are automatically applied to your documentation. Follow these steps to add source code fragments to your documentation: Add source comment tags at the beginning and the end of the part of code you want to use in your code block. Use this tag to include the fragment into the adoc documentation. The example in the following subchapters uses the tag exampleInclude to add a code fragment. Tags for the inclusion of source code from a source code file [...] // tag::exampleInclude[] (1) (2) function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor /examplecode.js[tags=exampleInclude] (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block You can reference this anchor using > 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Directly include the source code within the source code file with a tag marking fragment. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. For more information see the Asciidoctor reference. This is how the reference looks like inside the adoc file: ASAM example code block included by tags function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) { const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit; dolor = sit - amet(dolor); return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block. Reference this anchor using > 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Insert the code block. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. This is how the correctly configured snippet looks like in the adoc file: ASAM example code block included in an asciidoc file Use [source, osc2] as a source block identifier for fragments and snippets (see example) to define the language type as 'osc2'. This enables future automatic syntax highlighting. The project uses the adoc attribute draft to steer the review process. This FAQ helps you to manage the review and attribute handling. Q1 What is this draft-attribute for? New content on the master branch has to be marked with the ifdef::draft[] - endif::draft[] 'feature flag' mechanism. New content in this case means content in adoc files that is not already reviewed and agreed on, like newly merged text from a development branch. A typical adoc topic looks like this: [#top-an-example-topic] = Topic heading ifdef::draft[] Some content that is new or still needs to be reviewed and agreed on. endif::draft[] Some other content that is already reviewed and ready for being part of the standard documentation. When a review is started, a WG-Lead or a member of the CCB removes the draft-mechanism for the part that has to be reviewed in the review merge request. Q2 I cannot see my content in the preview. What is wrong?:: You may experience an empty preview in your editor when editing files that contain the mechanism. + This is actually a good sign. The preview is working correctly and hides all parts marked as draft. + To make the parts visible again, you have to set the attribute draft for your preview window. In the Asciidoc extension settings go to Preview:Attributes - Edit in settings.json. In the settings.json add the draft attribute: \"asciidoc.preview.attributes\": { \"draft\": \"\" } Save settings.json Go to Settings on the right hand side of the preview Go to the Preview settings tab Add an Asciidoctor Attribute by double-clicking an empty attribute line Add attribute draft with value true Save the settings (small button on the lower left of the tab!) Reload the preview Other tools should have similar settings. The preview in Gitlab intentionally shows the release version of the files, meaning that the parts marked as draft are hidden. You can easily switch off the preview and view the source content by clicking on the display source-icon on top of the file window: Figure 2. How to switch to source-view in Gitlab The icon next to it switches back to the preview. Q3 My preview looks fine. Why do I get feedback that something is not formatted correctly?:: Please note that all the previews described in this chapter are just for your convenience. The only reliable documents for reviews are the html-artifacts generated by the CI-pipeline! These artifacts are linked at the beginning of review merge requests. You can also download the artifacts directly from the pipeline result page.

This guide is intended to help you writing content for the ASAM XiL project. It provides you a set of hints and rules that make it easier to contribute concise and homogeneous content and documents to the project. Use \"English (US)\" (ISO: en-US) as a language setting in your text editor. Mnemonic: -or, -l, -yze, -er Table 1. American English No Yes colour, behaviour color, behavior labelling labeling analyse analyze centre center Use these modal verbs to express the level of obligation: Table 2. Proper modal verbs Level of obligation Verb to use Colloquial meaning Requirement shall, shall not mandatory statement, \"it must do/have\", \"it is not allowed to do/have\" Recommendation should, should not \"it is good/bad practice to do/have\" Permission may \"it is allowed to do/have and also allowed not to do/have\" Possibility can, cannot \"it depends on some circumstances if or if not\" The differences between these verbs are subtle and sometimes difficult to grasp. The table with modal verbs is based on ISO guidelines but currently under discussion. It is possible that the table will be simplified in the future. Write short sentences. If sentences get too long, consider splitting them up into shorter sentences. Keep headings short (only one line). Table 3. Shortness is key No Yes 3.1 Hints on how to maintain the printer 3.1 Printer maintenance Due to the fact that they were able to come to an agreement, a name changing of the file took place. The file was renamed. Present tense is easy to understand. Present tense is the preferred tense to express technical facts. Table 4. Present tense No Yes Chapter X will describe the details. Chapter X describes the details. Active voice is easier to understand than passive voice. Table 5. Passive voice and active voice No Yes The variable is set by the user. The user sets the variable. The car is driven to the garage by me. I drive the car to the garage. Simple constructs require fewer words and are easier to read. Table 6. Simple constructs No Yes in order to to has the possibility to can Some less common abbreviations may confuse the reader. Avoid them. Table 7. No abbreviations No Yes e.g. for example i.e. meaning Stick to the same word for an element or concept. Table 8. Use words consistently No Yes Press the key. After hitting the button the pop-up appears. Press the key. After pressing the key a pop-up appears. Do not use words like \"basically\", \"actually\", \"very\", \"practically\", …​ Use 'that' and 'which' to express the information level: 'that' adds essential information, no commas are used. 'which' adds information that can be left out, commas are used. Table 9. Precision matters Information No Yes Essential: Talking about that specific car they own. The car they own is old. The car which they own is old. The car that they own is old. Additional: The color of the car is not an essential information. The vehicle that is red drives down the road. The vehicle, which is red, drives down the road. Only use 'since' to refer to a point in time. Errors since startup. Always use 'because' to express reason. (Since can lead to ambiguity if used to express reason, see example.) Table 10. Since and because No Yes The system cannot calculate a result, since the data is missing. (time duration or cause?) The system cannot calculate a result, because the data is missing. Stick to one spelling for a word that allows several spellings. (For example, e-mail, email, or E-mail.) Stick to one style to present information. (For example, steps are always presented as a numbered list.) Stick to one formatting for a special purpose. (See Typographic conventions for XiL for more details.) AsciiDoc offers markup characters for words and terms. Here is how to use them correctly in the floating text for XiL: Italic Markup character: Underscore (_) Example: _term_ Use italic in the following cases: For glossary terms For new terms To emphasize terms Code elements Markup character: Backtick (\\`) Example: `term` Use code elements for: Names of classes Names of attributes Names of parameters One-line code examples File names For plural forms: Never add a plural '-s' to code element names. Use \"instances/elements/objects/types of \" instead. Table 11. Code elements plural forms No Yes Create six MyVectors. Create six instances of MyVector. See Source code for more details on source code. Bold Markup character: Asterisk (*) Example: *term* Do not use bold for terms in floating text. This markup is reserved for Structuring elements, like sub-headings that should not appear in the table of contents. Emphasis, for example single characters in formulae or tables. Asciidoc renderers take care of a typographically correct output. Therefore it is sufficient to use the following characters for punctuation marks: Quotation marks Use normal double quotation marks \" (ASCII #34, Unicode U+0022). The character can be found on the keyboard (Shift-2). Never use single quotation marks. Apostrophes Use normal apostrophes ' (ASCII #39, Unicode U+0027). The character can be found on the keyboard (Shift-#). Hyphen Use the minus sign - (ASCII #45, Unicode U+002D) for hyphen. The character can be found on the keyboard (-). Dashes Use the minus sign - (ASCII #45, Unicode U+002D) for dashes. The character can be found on the keyboard (-). Do not use other typographic characters like rounded quotation marks, en-dashes and so on. Insert a line break after each sentence. No manual line breaks inside sentences. ⇒ \"Only hit 'enter' after a period ('.'), but make sure to hit 'enter' after a period.\" 1 This is the first sentence. 2 This is the second sentence. 3 This is the third sentence. Use paragraphs to structure your text. A new thought or statement requires a new paragraph. An empty line creates a new paragraph. 1 This is the first sentence of the first paragraph. 2 This is the second sentence of the first paragraph. 3 4 This is the first sentence of the second paragraph. Use manual line breaks sparingly. To force adoc to make a line break within a paragraph, end the line before the break with a space followed by a plus sign (` +`). After this sentence a line break is needed. + This sentence appears on a new line. * Useful for lists + Detailed explanations begin in a new line after the main list element. After this sentence a line break is needed. This sentence appears on a new line. Useful for lists Detailed explanations begin in a new line after the main list element. In headings and captions only the first word begins with an uppercase letter (sentence-style capitalization). Exception: Acronyms and proper names are spelled as is. Table 12. Use of uppercase in headings and captions No Yes Wrong Formatting of a Heading Correct formatting of a heading ASAM rules to follow ASAM rules to follow Scope of OpenScenario Scope of OpenSCENARIO All topics, figures, tables and code examples shall have a unique tag: [#top-] for topics [#fig-] for figures (images, diagrams, and so on) [#tab-] for tables [#code-] for source code blocks Sections may also have a tag [#sec-] if a link to the section is needed. Use a semantically fitting string as . For the uid-string use a combination of: lowercase letters a-z numbers 0-9 ###todo as separators Some hints to create a unique id: Add an abbreviation that corresponds to the name of the main document as part of the id. For example, add 'pg' for all anchors used in the _P_rogrammers _G_uide. For anchors for figures (#fig-) it is recommended to use a unique id that has a relation to the figure name (see also File names for figures). Examples: [#top-pg-ees-port-introduction] [#fig-pg-overview22-diagram5] [#tab-pg-important-elements-of-can] [#code-pg-protocol-syntax-example1] [#sec-pg-important-section-to-be-linked-to] Use four space characters per indentation level. Do not use tab characters. Use the following text editor settings: Tab size: 4 Insert spaces Table 13. Four spaces indentation (spaces marked as '.') No Yes Normal text →Level 1 indented text →→Level 2 indented text Normal text …​.Level 1 indented text …​…​..Level 2 indented text Use only lowercase for file and folder names. Use the underscore '###todo' instead of 'space' in file and folder names. Use .adoc as file ending for documents. Table 14. Use of uppercase and underscores in file and folder names No Yes ExampleFileName.adoc example_file_name.adoc Another file name.adoc another_file_name.adoc Writing_guide.adoc writing_guide.adoc The file name of a figure shall be the same as the caption of this figure, with the following adaptions: Use only lowercase letters for the file name. Use ###todo as separators. Example: Figure headline: \"Port definition interfaces of the XYZ framework configuration object model\" File name: ###todo UML diagrams must be provided as PlantUML files (*.puml). Charts and other diagrams shall preferably be provided as scalable vector graphics (*.svg). Alternatively, portable network graphics (*.png) may also be used. Do not use figure file formats other than PlantUML, SVG or PNG. Each adoc-file is placed in a separate folder that is named after the contained adoc-file. Use one file per topic for larger chapters. Image files are kept per adoc-file. They are stored in a sub-folder called \"images\" next to the adoc-file. Example directory structure ├───food │ ├───fruit │ │ ├───apples │ │ │ ├───images │ │ │ │ ├───wellant.svg │ │ │ │ ├───golden_delicious.svg │ │ │ │ ├───gala.png │ │ │ └───apples.adoc │ │ │ │ │ ├───berries │ │ ├───images │ │ │ ├───blueberries.png │ │ │ ├───gooseberries.svg │ │ │ ├───goji.svg │ │ ├───berries_introduction.adoc │ │ ├───berries_definitions.adoc │ │ └───berries_examples.adoc │ │ │ └───vegetables │ │ ├───potatoes │ │ │ └───images │ │ │ │ └───... │ │ │ └───potatoes.adoc ... Lists are a great way to present lots of similar information in a compact form. Use numbered lists (AsciiDoc .) for steps that require a specific order. A numbered list example . First step . Second step . Third step First step Second step Third step Use bullet points (AsciiDoc *) for enumerations and elements that do not require a specific order. A bullet point list example * Two apples * One banana * One orange Two apples One banana One orange You can use lists inside lists and define several levels of sub-lists. A complex numbered list example . First step .. First sub-step .. Second sub-step ... First step inside second sub-step ... Second step inside second sub-step .. Third sub-step . Second step . Third step First step First sub-step Second sub-step First step inside second sub-step Second step inside second sub-step Third sub-step Second step Third step A complex bullet list example * Bullet one * Bullet two ** Sub-bullet one ** Sub-bullet two *** Sub-sub-bullet one ** Sub-bullet three * Bullet three Bullet one Bullet two Sub-bullet one Sub-bullet two Sub-sub-bullet one Sub-bullet three Bullet three Introduce lists with complete sentences, ending with a colon. Start all list items with an uppercase letter. Ensure similar structure for all list items, for example, whole sentences vs. nouns. End sentences with a period. Do not use closing punctuation for single words, noun phrases, verbs, adjectives, etc. Do not write lists as a continuous sentence. In bulleted and numbered lists, end each list item with a period if the following applies: Any item forms a complete sentence when combined with the list introduction that precedes the colon. Exception: Do not use periods if all items have three or fewer words or if the items are UI labels, headings, subheadings, or strings. Any item by itself is a complete sentence. Do not use semicolons, commas, or conjunctions (like 'and' or 'or') at the end of list items. Examples of correctly formatted lists: My pets like the following: My cat likes to hunt in the fields. My dog is happy when we go out for a walk. My guinea pig wants to sleep all day. I like the following types of fruit: Apples Bananas Cherries Figures - like images, pictures or drawings - may be used to illustrate complex facts. Preferred format: .svg Alternative format: .png Figures are stored in a sub-folder named images located inside the chapter folder. See also Directory structure. The name of the image file shall match the anchor name (excluding the fig- prefix) The exact adherence to this syntax is absolutely necessary for the automatic generation of the list of figures at the end of the document. Each image shall have: A tag starting with #fig- A caption The image::-link to the picture An alternative text [#fig-] . image::[] Example: [#fig-project-structure] .Overview of the project structure image::project-structure.svg[] Set the :imagesdir: only in the root adoc-file that compiles all the adoc-files into a single document (the so-called mapping-file main.adoc). With each include in the root document, the imagesdir must be set to the parent-folder of the images-folder of the included adoc-file. Despite its name, the attribute :imagesdir: shall not contain the name of the images-folder itself, but the name of the parent-folder of the images-folder. This way, the images are displayed in an adoc-preview, even if only the sub-topic is opened. No need to open the main.doc all the time for image previews. Example for main.adoc: :imagesdir: apples include::apples/apples.adoc[leveloffset=+1] :imagesdir: berries include::berries/berries_introduction.adoc[leveloffset=+1] include::berries/berries_definitions.adoc[leveloffset=+1] include::berries/berries_examples.adoc[leveloffset=+1] or: :workdir: apples :imagesdir: {workdir} include::{workdir}/apples.adoc[leveloffset=+1] ... Do not set the attribute imagesdir in subordinated adoc-files. Paths in the image-macros are relative to the adoc file. The image-macros also work when previewing only a single subordinated adoc file. PlantUML diagrams are included as a file. Each diagram shall have: A tag starting with #fig- A caption The block format identifier [plantuml] The include::-link, surrounded by block markers ---- An alternative text [#fig-] . [plantuml] ---- include::[] ---- Example: [#fig-root-package-class-diag] .Class diagram for the root package [plantuml] ---- include::my-class-diagram.puml[class diagram for root package] ---- The images generated from the PlantUML diagrams during the creation of the output document shall have SVG format. This is globally configured with the document attribute :plantuml-format: in the document header. Example: [#top-my-document] = My document :description: A generic document :revdate: 2020-03-13 ... :plantuml-format: svg Use tables if you have to present a huge amount of similar data in a compressed form. A table shall have: A tag A caption [#tab-uid] .This is the caption of the table |=== |cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3 |cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3 |cell 3_1 | cell 3_2 | cell 3_3 |=== Table 15. This is the caption of the table cell 1_1 cell 1_2 cell 1_3 cell 2_1 cell 2_2 cell 2_3 cell 3_1 cell 3_2 cell 3_3 Nested tables are also possible. [cols=\"2,2a\"] |=== | col 1 | col 2 | cell 1.1 | cell 1.2 | cell 2.1 | cell 2.2 [cols=\"1,1\"] !=== ! n_col 1 ! n_col 2 ! n_c 11 ! n_c 12 !=== |=== col 1 col 2 cell 1.1 cell 1.2 cell 2.1 cell 2.2 n_c 1.1 n_c 1.2 n_c 2.1 n_c 2.2 AsciiDoc offers a huge amount of attributes to build more complicated tables and to affect the style of tables. See https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/table-ref/ for details. Some useful examples for table formatting: Span cells by using the span factor and span operator of the cell specifier. (Examples: 3+|: Cell spans three columns, .2+|: Cell spans two rows.) Using cell spans may cause border frame displaying issues. Use sparingly. Adjust the column width with the column attribute [cols=\",\"], using the numbers n and m to define the relative width between the columns. (Example: cols=\"2,4\": Second column is twice as wide as the first one.) The format of references in the text is fixed and depends on the type of element the reference points to: Table 16. Types of references and their format Type No Yes Table See Table-Name See following table See Table x Figure See Figure-Name See follwing figure See Figure x Chapter See Chapter x.y See Chapter Chapter-Name See Section x.y See Section Chapter-Name See x.y Chapter-Name See x.y See Chapter-Name Appendix See Appendix-Name Bibliography See [x] Use xref:[{}] for references. The destination tag. Type-specific style for the reference: fig-style Reference to figure tab-style Reference to table top-style Reference to chapter sec-style Reference to other destinations Examples See xref:top-an-important-chapter[{top-style}] for details. See xref:fig-a-nice-figure[{fig-style}] for details. Sometimes you may need to display a character that is reserved for adoc-formatting. Here is how to do it. Underscore (_) Use _ to display an underscore. Pound sign (#) Use # to display a pound sign. Check mark (✔) Use ✔ to display a check mark. Protected space ( ) Use {nbsp} to define a space character is not used for automatic line breaks. This is especially useful for value-unit-pairs like 5{nbsp}m/s (5 m/s) to ensure that value and unit are always in the same line of text. Word joiner (⁠) Use {wj} to glue two words together. This is useful to enhance readability, for example when adding footnotes (term{wj}footnote:[text]). A page break can be forced using (5) ---- (6) 1 Insert an anchor for the code block. Reference this anchor using xref:asamprojectguide:compendium:writing_guidelines/writing_guide.adoc#code-example-code-block[Writing guide] 2 Insert a caption for the code block. 3 Define the source code language for code highlighting. For example, osc2, xml, or java. 4 Insert a code block delimiter. 5 Insert the code block. 6 Insert a code block delimiter. This is how the correctly configured snippet looks like in the adoc file: ASAM example code block included in an asciidoc file You can refer to lines of code in two ways: Use callouts to refer to single lines. Use automatic line numbering. Use Asciidoc callouts to refer to lines of source code, for example to add a detailed explanation after the code block. Add a comment with a reference number in angle brackets at the end of the line in the source block: # (x = 1, 2, …​) Marking the reference number as a comment allows users to copy-and-paste the code as working code. After the source block repeat the number in angle brackets, followed by the explanation text. Example: [source, osc2, linenums] ---- A normal line A line with a callout # Another normal line Another line with a callout # ---- The explanation for the first callout. The explanation for the second callout. Result: A normal line A line with a callout (1) Another normal line Another line with a callout (2) 1 The explanation for the first callout. 2 The explanation for the second callout. An automatic line numbering mechanism is also available, for example to refer to the code later in the text. Use [source, osc2, linenums] as a source block identifier to enable line numbering. Later in the text use the anchor of the code example together with the line number to refer to the line: In >, line x, ... Please note that any preview of a tool is just for your convenience. The only reliable documents for reviews are the pdf-artifacts generated by the CI-pipeline! These artifacts are linked at the main Gitlab-page of the project.

When working with documents originally intended for a single-file-inclusion strategy, local references that only work if other files are also included will not work for the individual pages in Antora. To circumvent this problem, the ASAM Antora extensions analyze all pages and try to find the source file of the reference. If the content is included in multiple pages, pages in the navigation structured are prioritized over unlisted pages. Note, however, that this approach has limitations and should only be used if switching to a more Antora-native approach is too difficult! Targets must have explicit anchors, not only section names Activate the extension in the site.yml. Add unique (i.e. unique over all pages in the project!) anchors to all pages, sections, or other positions.

However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters. In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages. Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages. To fulfill this requirement, the \"Page numbering\" extension features were implemented. These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two (\"== \") sections on each page). Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential figure and table numbers. Only pages with the attribute sectnums are considered: set it per page or apply globally/per component All relevant pages are in the navigation tree The following table lists the supported attributes as well as their default values: Attribute Description Default Example numbered_titles De-/activates the automatic numbering of pages and sections in Antora for all pages where \"sectnums\" is set. false numbered_titles: true The ASAM Antora extension, in combination with the sectnumsoffset_antora extension for Asciidoctor, creates sequential page and section numbers in Antora. To use this feature, add numbered_titles: true to the Antora extension configuration. The sectnums attribute must be set on each page where the extension shall apply the sequential numbering. sectnums can also be defined per component (in the component’s \"antora.yml\") or globally (in the site’s \"site.yml\"), depending on the use-case. The order can also be manually changed by adding the attributes :sectnumoffset: and/or :titleoffset: to the page or a section therein. When using a manual override, the offset must be defined as (..(…​)). Example: :titleoffset: 2.3. would set the page number to \"2.3.\" and the first section therein to \"2.3.1\". In addition to that, some general actions can be added as attributes in the navigation files. :start-level: Defines the level in the bullet point list from which on the sequential numbers are added. By default, this is set to 1, meaning that every item starting with \"*\" or higher will be included. If set to a higher number, page title numbers will only be added from that level onward. For example, if it is set to 3, all bullet points \"\\*\" and \"*\\*\" will be excluded and counting starts with the first element of \"*\\*\\*\". :reset-level-offset: Resets the counter back to the start value. :sectnums!: Deactivate section numbers for the next bullet point. [preface] Disables section and title numbers for the next bullet point in the list and adds the [preface] role to the referenced page, if possible. Note that this has no immediate effect since [preface] is not supported in the document type article that is mandatory for Antora! [appendix] Sets section and title numbers to start with capital letters. Page titles get a prefix of {appendix-caption} {appendix-letter}: `, where `{appendix-caption} is the chosen Asciidoctor appendix caption (default: \"Appendix\") and {appendix-letter} the next available letter in the alphabet for the appendix (start value: \"A\").

The paper shall include the findings of the project group and proposals for ASAM standards. Proposals for ASAM standards shall be as specific as possible. Ideally, the concept project documents their proposals in a copy & past ready format, as it could be taken over into the respective ASAM standard.

Summary Purpose Develop supplementary products supporting the application of ASAM standards Funding Limit 75% Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase An implementation project has the purpose to create a supplementary product that supports the ap-plication of an ASAM standard in the industry. An ASAM product shall cover one of the following use-cases: supports the development of standard-based, commercial products(e.g. development tool kit) ensures standard-based interoperability of commercial products(e.g. source code) reduce the development costs of commercial products(e.g. source code) is used for testing the standard compliance of commercial products(e.g. checker tool, test suite, source code) Another auxiliary purpose of an implementation project can be to support the standard development by providing feedback from the implementers to the standard developers to improve the quality and maturity of the standard while it is still in development. For liability reasons, ASAM shall develop and distribute source code only as a result of an implementation project. Members may use the source code to create tools or other executables from the source code. As an example, implementation projects may include the development of source code for one of the following products. This list is not exhaustive and should only serve as a guideline of what might be a meaningful, supplementary product to an ASAM standard. Checker tool for syntax checks of non-schema-based file formats Checker tool for plausibility checks of schema-based file formats Checker tool for API checks Add-on or plug-in for de-facto standard IDEs (e.g. MATLAB, Simulink, Eclipse etc.) Importers or parsers Exporters or generators Reference implementations of tools or tool components Behavioral software components Additions to popular open-source projects (e.g. Eclipse, openMDM, Artop, etc.) API stubs and skeletons The deliverable(s) of an implementation project must have product-quality. Consequently, ASAM products are professionally developed in accordance to customary quality guidelines of the automotive or IT industries, whichever is applicable. This requires that the software is developed by a contractor, while the ASAM project group controls and reviews the contractor’s implementation. For example, schemata definition files shall be commented. Further rules and guidelines for this project type are set forth in the document \"GuidelinesForASAMCheckerTools\". Upon request, ASAM provides funding up to 100% of the project’s required budget. Excluded are expenses for meeting participation and travel. Implementation projects are carried out via the standard development process. The following process steps are not mandatory and are skipped by default, unless otherwise decided by the TSC or the project group: P1: Proposal Workshop C: Review Phase When members propose the further development of a standard, for which an ASAM product exists, members must also propose the further development of this product, unless the pro-posed changes of the standard have no impact on the product. If the ASAM product shall not be further developed, then ASAM shall publicly announce that the development of the product is discontinued. ASAM products shall not compete with a member company’s product business(non-competition clause). Members can object an implementation project proposal and shall provide a justification for their objection. The TSC checks during P5 Project Approval, whether the objection is justified. In case of a justified objection, the TSC shall not approve the proposed project or decide on measures that would remove the member’s objection. Non-distributable source code files shall include the following comment text in the file header: Header template for non-distributable source code // // © by ASAM e.V., // // Any use is limited to the scope described in the ASAM license terms. See https://www.asam.net/license.html[window=_blank] for further details.

Summary Purpose Develop supplementary products supporting the application of ASAM standards Funding Limit none Process Standard Development Process except: Proposal Workshop Review Phase Study projects provide members an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards in a collaborative way. Study projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards among the participants, to promote their application in member companies and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards. This project type is specifically intended for members in regions, where ASAM standards are not well known. The content of study projects can be, but is not limited to: collaborative self-study of an ASAM standard receive training on an ASAM standard carry out a suitability analysis of an ASAM standard against defined use-cases carry out a pilot project to become familiar with the practical application of ASAM-related tools carry out an interoperability analysis of ASAM-related tools Study projects have no expected deliverables other than a final report. The members of study projects shall be pledged to submit change requests, if they find issues or gaps in ASAM standards. The standard development process does not apply for study projects in case that either no budget or a small budget is needed. The process to request, approve and carrying out a study project is: Member submits a study project information sheet to the ASAM Office for project approval. ASAM Office checks the information and approves or rejects the project. ASAM Office informs the TSC about the project. ASAM Office publishes an announcement of the project. The study project starts and is being carried out as described in the study project information sheet. The ASAM Office monitors the project activities. Some further rules apply for study projects: Participation in study projects is open for all ASAM members, e.g. also to members in a non \"active\"membership class. Participation in a study project can be restricted to members of a specific region, e.g. Japan only. The working language can be different than English. The project members elect a project leader. Meetings are documented via meeting minutes in English language. The minutes may be translated into the working language of the study group. The project members use the ASAM IT infrastructure. Upon request, ASAM provides funding for study projects up to the limit for small budget projects. In case that a larger budget is required beyond the limit of a small budget project, then the project must be requested via the regular project proposal process, which consist of the process steps P2 Proposal Writing, P3 Proposal Submission, P4 Proposal Publication and P5 Proposal Decision by the TSC.

It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration ef-forts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. The only exception is, that a new feature has been forgotten in an earlier release of the standard and is absolutely required for a functional and meaningful standard. A new revision version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. The only exception is, that the correction of an error or the removal of an ambiguity cannot be reasonably solved in any other way than breaking the backward-compatibility. An exception requires approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Revision development projects may be converted to a minor or major version development project during the course of the project term, if backward-compatibility issues turn out to be too severe or new features need to be added.

Proposals, concept papers and standards are written as AsciiDoc files. All project content is stored, organized, versioned and discussed through a repository on GitLab, which is provided by ASAM. The GitLab pipeline creates the required final documents, typically as .html or as .pdf. To contribute to a Project Proposal, project members can either contribute through GitLab issues or contribute directly in AsciiDoc. Both can be performed without software installation directly through the Gitlab IDE. However, if you prefer to work on your local computer, ASAM recommends using Git and Visual Studio Code. Still TODO! Currently not fully supported yet. If you want to contribute more directly, you can easily transition through the approach of creating development branches from issues. The most direct way of contributing to a project is by creating and editing the AsciiDoc files. However, in order for a consistent workflow and optimal use of the automation steps set up by ASAM, users must first familiarize themselves with the instructions on GitLab and AsciiDoc and follow them. This ensures that all projects work the same way and deliver the same high level of quality that is expected from an ASAM standard. Each project proposal has the same base structure which is described and explained in the README.adoc file at root level of the repository. Consider the correct document before adding new content to a file. Do not edit the main.adoc file directly! All content is included through the files in the folder subchapters. The repository-based approach of ASAM for working on documents allows members to work in parallel on the same documents without the risk of overwriting each others changes without notice. Users must follow the Workflow tutorial for the projects using gitlab. All Simulation domain standards at ASAM are written using the AsciiDoc format. AsciiDoc is a mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.

Used by ASAM in their projects. GitLab Popular Open Source platform ASAM uses that leverages Git. Remote The server, i.e. not on your PC, often used to refer to the master repository of a project on a server. The default name on (local) git is \"origin\". Local A locally (on your pc) stored (cloned) version of the remote repository. Working Copy Files that are not yet handled by git or that contain changes git is not \"aware\" of. Staging Area Collection of files or changes that git is aware of but that are not yet part of the history. Merge Request If the changes made in a separate branch of a project are to be combined with another branch (usually the main or master branch), a Merge Request is triggered to review the changes and solve any conflicts where two independently made changes on the same file would interfere with one another. Clone Done once to obtain a local copy of a remote repository. Add Will add new and changed files to the Staging Area. Commit Save the state of a repository (ideally with a \"commit message\" that gives some background). This \"snapshot\" only applies to the local repository. It applies the staging area or, if used with the command '-a', all changes, staged or unstaged. Push Copy the committed changes to the remote. Pull Update your local copy with all changes that have been made to the remote. Branch Diverge from the main line of development by creating a branch; this has a pointer to a specific commit in the parent to make it clear where it started. Merge Integrate the changes made in one branch into another. Most times, this is used to integrate the changes from your branch to the main (master) branch. It is best practice to check for changes on remote before changing files locally and before pushing changes to remote. The Git workflow for making changes is a 3 step process: Figure 1. Git Worklfow Add files from the working copy to the staging area. Commit staged files to your local repo. Push to a remote repository. If you want to work on a repository locally, you need to first check it out from remote (GitLab). To do so, follow one of the cloning instructions below. If your project contains submodules, make sure to also update them. See Submodules in git for more information. This only needs to be done once to obtain a local copy. Find the repository url on the website and copy the git url Open the Visual Studio Code command palette, type Git: Clone, then press Enter Paste the copied git url and press Enter Select the folder on your PC where you want to save the repository If you encounter an error that the host key verification failed, you need to add GitLab to your known_host file.

Confirm with Enter With this command, you do not need to manually initialize the submodules after checkout! Alternatively to the Git Bash, you can also use the PowerShell with the same commands.

If you are unsure if git is installed, you can check by entering the following in a shell window and confirming: git --version If a git version is returned, git is already installed on your system. If git is not installed, follow the instructions on how to install git After installation of Git, configure your user credentials that Git uses when checking in changed content from your PC to the ASAM GitLab. To make sure your commits match your name and email details, a one time configuration is necessary. Open a shell or terminal (e.g. PowerShell) window Execute the following command and replace the entries \"FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME\" accordingly: git config --global user.name \"FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME\" Example 1. Setting git user name for Max Mustermann git config --global user.name Max Mustermann Next, execute the following command and replace the entry \"MY_NAME@example.com\" with your comany’s email: git config --global user.email \"MY_NAME@example.com\" Example 2.

Entering a passphrase is optional and leads to additional steps every time you connect to the remote, so it is not recommended. Add the generated SSH public key to your GitLab account by following these instructions. Verify that you can connect If you cannot click \"Next\", make sure Visual Studio Code is already installed. Return to the previous step and continue again. Now, the \"next\" button should be active.

Here, you get an overview over how Visual Studio Code is structured. The Command Palette in Visual Studio Code allows you to access specific menus and functions of the program directly without having to navigate there through the menu strucutre. It also helps when looking for an option to change as it contains a search function with auto-completion. Ctrl+Shift+P brings up the Command Palette. From here, you have access to all of the functionality of VSCode, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations. Many tutorials in this guide for VSCode make use of the Command Palette. The Activity Bar contains a direct access to many important base or extensions features. The following image shows standard functionality, but some extensions like GitLens will add their own icon and features. Visual Studio Code can be adapted to each project’s and the user’s needs. This is done by installing and using extensions. This section shows how to install a new extension from the marketplace. As an example, we will use the AsciiDoc extension. The AsciiDoc extension for VSCode_ allows for easy creation and supported editing of AsciiDoc or adoc files within _VSCode. For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension. You can access that documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace. Access the extensions window through the VSCode menu bar → View → Extensions. Search for AsciiDoc (or use asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) & install it. The AsciiDoc extension will add the syntax the AsciiDoc interpreter to VSCode so you can use the preview feature and have syntax highlighting. Figure 1. AsciiDoc (id: asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) VSCode has a lot of very helpful extensions that can be downloaded and installed through the integrated marketplace. You can view the recommended list of extensions here. VSCode is already without extensions very powerful and user friendly. One thing that can make the VSCode experience even better are the extensions. There is a list of extensions we recommend that will make your life contributing to the ASAM standards way easier. Installing an extension is really easy, just enter the extension menu, search for the desired extension. Then, click on the Install-Button. The AsciiDoc extension will add the syntax the AsciiDoc interpreter to VSCode so you can use the preview feature and have syntax highlighting. Figure 2. AsciiDoc (id: asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode) The Comment Anchor extension provides you with the ability of adding highlighted keywords to the raw text. Figure 3. Comment Anchors examples The extension also lets you search for all available anchors in the repository or current file and offers a jump-to option. Figure 4. Comment Anchors (id: exodiusstudios.comment-anchors) The Draw.io extension for Visual Sudio Code allows for easy creation and assisted editing of drawio and other files supported by Draw.io within Visual Studio Code. For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension. You can access that documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace. Figure 5. Draw.io Integration (id: hediet.vscode-drawio) The Draw.io extension does not support remote custom libraries as of now. For this reason, it is recommended to create and make larger edits to drawio files through the web app. The Code Spell Checker extension provides you with the ability of spell checking in Visual Studio Code. Figure 6. Code Spell Checker example 1 Figure 7. Code Spell Checker example 2 Figure 8. Code Spell Checker example 3 The spell checker handles standard text as well as CamelCase. Figure 9. Code Spell Checker (id: streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) The Git Graph extension is a great tool navigating the branches in the git repository and provides a great overview. Figure 10. Git Graph (id: mhutchie.git-graph) The GitLens Extension is a great extension to follow up on all the changes made to the documents within the repository. Gitlens provides: Repository Overview File History Line History Commit Comparison Figure 11. GitLens — Git supercharged (id: eamodio.gitlens) The Docker extension lets you directly interact with Docker through Visual Studio Code. You can run, for example, the docker-compose.yml directly without having to open a console or using Docker Desktop. Figure 12.

However, it is deactivated by default and must be configured before first use. This requires a diagram server. There are multiple options: Use the public kroki.io server Deploy your own server Run a kroki docker container on your local machine We will go with option 1. This extension will send graph information to https://kroki.io. If this is an issue, it is also possible to use your own kroki instance (see here for more information).

Once a document is written by the group/service provider, we want to review and comment on the document. Unfortunatelly, there is no native built-in comment feature in GitLab and/or VSCode.

Never work on the master branch, always create your own development branch! To work on the files in your branch, you can either use the Gitlab IDE or a local setup consisting of text editor and Git. For the tools supported by ASAM, see Tools overview. Each topic must be developed in a separate development branch before it is merged to main when ready. Please keep in mind to change only few files at once in one branch to minimize the chance for merge conflicts to occur. Give the branch a significant name that describes its intensions. See Branch naming conventions for branch name conventions at ASAM. If you want to switch the branch you are viewing and working on, see How to switch branches. The recommended way of working is by using issues. The general idea is: Whenever an issue is opened, a branch is created with it. Thus, it is possible to work on the issue in an individual branch and merge that branch back to main after the issue is done. Create an issue, using one of the available templates. Fill out the neccessary fields. Keep the size of the issue reasonable, for example by trying to have it cover about 8 hours of work. Open your issue and create your branch from it. Follow the Branch naming conventions for the branch name. Now, the ticket is created and we can start working on the issue. When working on the issue, document your progress to be able to know when the task is done. Please keep the documentation for the progress short and simple. If there are open points that need to be discussed with the group, start a new thread in the issue so others can reply to your suggestion or question A thread in an issue looks like the image below. As soon as the issue is done, create a merge request for the branch to start an internal review. Alternatively, you can create your branch manually, either through GitLab or locally (if set up). There a many ways to create a branch in the git process. Two options are highlighted below. Figure 1. Create a new branch in VSCode Click on the branch icon on the bottom left Click on \"Create New Branch\" Enter a new valid branch name and confirm with Enter You are automatically switched to the new branch. This is a local branch. You need to push it before it is also on the remote. Figure 2. select the dropdown menu for new branch Open an issue for which you want to create a new branch Select \"Create branch\" from the dropdown menu Figure 3. create name for new branch Enter a new valid branch name Click \"Create branch\" The branch is now created on remote. You need to check out this branch locally as this only creates the branch on the server. If you are using the Gitlab IDE, you can edit the files directly in your browser. If you are using a local setup, you can pull, change, stage, commit and push through Git. See the guide on Git interactions for further information on how to work with a repository. After you are done with your work, create a \"merge request\" to the main branch. This is described in Merge a branch. It is recommended to only merge a development branch once all issues related to it are closed. Each merge request must be reviewed internally with a simple review before it is allowed to be merged into main in order to minimize mistakes slipping through. Once a branch is merged into main, its changes are now offical and applied.","title":"Workflow tutorial for the projects using gitlab","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"","name":"workflow_tutorial","url":"/asamprojectguide/compendium/guides/git/workflow_tutorial.html","titles":[{"text":"Tooling","hash":"_tooling","id":1},{"text":"1.

However, in order for a consistent workflow and optimal use of the automation steps set up by ASAM, users must first familiarize themselves with the instructions on GitLab and AsciiDoc and follow them. This ensures that all projects work the same way and deliver the same high level of quality that is expected from an ASAM standard. Each project proposal has the same base structure which is described and explained in the README.adoc file at root level of the repository. Consider the correct document before adding new content to a file. Do not edit the main.adoc file directly! All content is included through the files in the folder subchapters. The repository-based approach of ASAM for working on documents allows members to work in parallel on the same documents without the risk of overwriting each others changes without notice. Users must follow the Workflow tutorial for the projects using gitlab. All Simulation domain standards at ASAM are written using the AsciiDoc format. AsciiDoc is a mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more. You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a normal text document. There are no markup tags or weird format notations.

With this, you do not need to install and configure software, programming languages etc: just download and use a pre-configured container that has all the relevant configuration already built in. From the docker homepage: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Figure 1. The Docker architecture For Asciidoc, docker can be used to run a pre-configured asciidoctor setup for creating html output locally. This removes the need to upload adoc files and use the build pipeline for every change you want to see. It also means you do not have to install and configure Asciidoctor first since this is already done in the pre-configured Docker image. If you do not have Docker installed, check out the Docker before continuing. If your project is currently missing the docker-compose.yml, see these Standard docker compose yAML on how to set it up. A project’s final specification document is created as HTML file. However, having to run it through the pipeline every time before being able to see the final result after having made changes is neither efficient nor friendly to the other workgroup members. To render a project’s documentation without having to upload it, use Docker Compose with a correctly defined docker-compose.yml file. For information on what YAML/yml means, see YAML on Wikipedia The VSCode extension for Asciidoc provides a decent preview. However, some styling and content will not look exactly as in the final result. If the layout and final look is important, you should create the HTMl output from the adoc files by using the asciidoctor docker container (configured in the standard docker-compose.yml). For information on how to execute docker-compose, see the Docker. Make sure to execute the asciidoctor service in the container as it may contain more than one service. After running docker-compose, one or more html files will have been created depending on your docker-compose.yml. If you use the standard configuration, the created file will be named \"HTML_standard_local_build.html\" and can be found in the same folder as your \"docker-compose.yml\" file.

With this, you do not need to install and configure software, programming languages etc: just download and use a pre-configured container that has all the relevant configuration already built in. From the docker homepage: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Figure 1. The Docker architecture For Asciidoc, docker can be used to run a pre-configured asciidoctor setup for creating html output locally. This removes the need to upload adoc files and use the build pipeline for every change you want to see. It also means you do not have to install and configure Asciidoctor first since this is already done in the pre-configured Docker image. If you do not have Docker installed, check out the Docker before continuing. If your project is currently missing the docker-compose.yml, see these Standard docker compose yAML on how to set it up. A project’s final specification document is created as HTML file. However, having to run it through the pipeline every time before being able to see the final result after having made changes is neither efficient nor friendly to the other workgroup members. To render a project’s documentation without having to upload it, use Docker Compose with a correctly defined docker-compose.yml file. For information on what YAML/yml means, see YAML on Wikipedia You can download the standard docker-compose.yml here. For Antora, the docker-compose is slightly different. You can see an example in the Project Guide repository. Create a new docker-compose.yml file in the root directory of the project. Add the following content to the created file: version: \"2\" services: asciidoctor: image: asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor volumes: - .:/documents entrypoint: asciidoctor --failure-level WARN -r asciidoctor-diagram -a mathjax -r asciidoctor-bibtex --trace standard/main.adoc -o HTML_standard_local_build.html Run docker-compose with docker-compose run asciidoctor Usually, the only adaption that may be required is to change the input file (standard/main.adoc).All the other configuration required is in the docker-compose.yml. It is also possible to include the running of scripts into this (e.g. adoc2LOFT) Each project may have slightly different requirements, and at different stages of the project different features are available or not. To accommodate for that, the docker-compose.yml can be configured with options in the entrypoint. If Asciidoctor Diagram is to be used, make sure that the option -r asciidoctor-diagram is set. Mathjax is a JavaScript display engine intended for displaying mathmatical expressions in browsers. This can be activated by adding -a mathjax to the entrypoint. If Asciidoctor Bibtex is to be used, make sure that the option -r asciidoctor-bibtex is set. The use of asciidoctor-bibtex requires that a bibtex configuration for the project is present. If the project does not have such a configuration (yet), remove this option. Otherwise, the container will fail to create any output! You can define the input file by using path-to-file/filename.format. In the standard version above, this is set to standard/main.adoc. Replace this, if necessary. If you want to process more than one file in one go, you can replace path-to-file, filename or both with *, so that it searches through all paths, files or both respectively. You can define the output file by using -o path-to-file/filename.format. By default, HTML is created, so use \".html\" as your format. In the standard version above, this is set to HTML_standard_local_build.html. If you only want to specifiy the output path but leave the naming convention of the input files, use the option -D path instead of Docker Docker best practices Docker guide Setting up docker Build Antora on your local PC How to use docker for asciidoctor Starting a container from docker desktop Windows subsystem for linux (WSL) Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions Running docker-Compose From VSCode","title":"Standard docker compose yAML","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"","name":"standard_docker_config","url":"/asamprojectguide/compendium/tools/docker/standard_docker_config.html","titles":[{"text":"Why use docker?","hash":"_why_use_docker","id":1},{"text":"Standard docker-Compose Instructions","hash":"_standard_docker_compose_instructions","id":2},{"text":"Typical configuration options","hash":"_typical_configuration_options","id":3},{"text":"Asciidoctor diagram","hash":"_asciidoctor_diagram","id":4},{"text":"Mathjax","hash":"_mathjax","id":5},{"text":"Asciidoctor bibtex","hash":"_asciidoctor_bibtex","id":6},{"text":"Single input file","hash":"_single_input_file","id":7},{"text":"Multiple input files","hash":"_multiple_input_files","id":8},{"text":"Output file","hash":"_output_file","id":9},{"text":"Output path","hash":"_output_path","id":10},{"text":"Related topics","hash":"_related_topics","id":11}]},"387":{"id":387,"text":"WSL is short for Windows Subsystem for Linux.

All available roles are defined in the file site.yml at root level of the repository. If you need to define a new role first, see How to add a new role. In order to work with roles, just add the attribute of that role to that page: Add the attribute {role-xyz} to the page’s body, where xyz is the name of the role (e.g. gtm). The role only works correctly if added to a page. Pages importing a partial with a role label will not show up correctly in the role’s overview! If the whole page relates to the role or roles, add the label right after the first empty line after the pages top includes, but before the first line of text. If only a section relates to a specific role, add that role after the section heading. If a page is relevant for multiple roles, add them in sequential lines (one role per line).","title":"Using roles","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"","name":"use_roles","url":"/asamprojectguide/project-guide/adding_content/roles/use_roles.html","titles":[{"text":"Recommendations","hash":"_recommendations","id":1}]},"437":{"id":437,"text":"This is a variation on the default page creation.

However, not all functions that ASAM requires for an efficient and partially automated content structuring are present by default. For this reason, an Antora extension and an Asciidoctor extension were created. This page collects all the features of this extension, such as the custom macros, and explains what they do and how to use them. Each macro also has a detailed instructions page with more details. For more information on how to write an Antora extension, see the official extension guide and check out the relevant package repositories, particularly their devdocs folders. The source repository of the ASAM extensions is https://code.asam.net/common/asam-antora-extensions. All following examples assume the extension is located under \"./antora_extensions\", where \".\" is the location of the \"site.yml\" file (the Antora playbook). Most extensions are not fully supported in partials, particularly those depending on Asciidoctor features like \"include\"! The following table describes general configuration on using the extension: Attribute Description Default Example id Defines an id by which the extension can be specifically called from the CLI. none id: asam-extension enabled De-/activates this extension by default. If deactivated, the extension must be explicitely called from the CLI. Only relevant in combination with id. true enabled: false require Describes the location of the extension. none require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js' Example 1. General configuration for ASAM Antora extensions in site.yml - id: asam-extensions require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js' The following sections describe features directly applied through the pipeline. These are features that typically are relevant to the whole site. They enact general rules or features, or they collect information about all content. Orphan pages Keyword-overview page Page numbering Sequential figure and table numbers ISO-2145 style section numbers Convert local to global page references The ASAM Antora extension finds all pages not listed in any nav.adoc and puts a warning in the console output. If configured, these pages can also automatically be listed under a separated navigation entry (e.g. \"orphans\") at the end of the Antora document. For more details, see Pipeline: Orphan pages. The ASAM Antora extension generates an overview page that lists all keywords used in the Antora pages. The location and the (virtual) filename can be configured in the site.yml (Antora playbook). For more details, see Pipeline: Keyword page. To see the result of the applied pipeline feature, see Used keywords In ASAM Project Guide By default, Antora does not support sequential page numbering. However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters. In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages. Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages. To fulfill this requirement, the \"Page numbering\" extension features were implemented. These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two (\"== \") sections on each page). Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential figure and table numbers. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential numbering. Since Asciidoctor counts all images and tables only within each page, their caption numbers start at 1 on every new Antora page by default. In case of standards, these numbers must be sequential (and unique) within each standard, not each page. Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential section numbers and page titles. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential figure and table numbers. By default, section numbers in Asciidoctor have a trailing dot (\".\"). To be in line with ISO 2145, sections in standards have to be numbered without this trailing dot. The Antora extension, in combination with the 'sectnums_to_iso' extension for Asciidoctor, addresses this problem. For more details, see Pipeline: ISO-2145 style section and page numbering. Using Asciidoctor, it is typical to create one main file and include content from separate files. With this approach, each section or chapter can be managed separately while still compiling everything into a single final document. However, in Antora these sections or chapters stay separate in most cases since the idea is to be able to access them individually and independently. When working with documents originally intended for a single-file-inclusion strategy, local references that only work if other files are also included will not work for the individual pages in Antora. To circumvent this problem, the ASAM Antora extensions analyze all pages and try to find the source file of the reference. If the content is included in multiple pages, pages in the navigation structured are prioritized over unlisted pages. Note, however, that this approach has limitations and should only be used if switching to a more Antora-native approach is too difficult! For more details, see Pipeline: Local to global anchor replacement. related reference pages role_related autonav Add related::[] in an empty line and replace with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference. You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword. To negate a keyword, use an exclamation mark (!) in front of it. For more details, see Macro: related Add reference::[] in an empty line and replace with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference. You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword. To negate a keyword, use an exclamation mark (!) in front of it. For more details, see Macro: reference Add page::[] in an empty line and replace with a list of arguments, separated by \",\" (comma). If you add no arguments, the macro will list all other pages in the same folder as this file. For more details, see Macro: pages Add role_related::[] in an empty line and replace with a list of role labels, separated by \",\" (comma), and with an (optional) list of limiting keywords, separated by \",\" (comma). For more details, see Macro: role_related This ONLY works in nav.adoc files, not in regular pages or partials! The macro must also always be used as a comment (similarly to the Asciidoctor macro \"tag\"). If the module has a main page, add //autonav::[] without parameters in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. If the module has no main page, add //autonav::[none] in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. The macro uses the following rules to determine the main page of a module: If there is a file named like the module on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"index.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"main.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else use the first page in the alphabetically sorted list. For more details, see Macro: autonav The source code can be found in the ASAM GitLab repository. To use the provided ASAM extensions in an ASAM project, add the extension repository git as submodule to your project. It is recommended to switch to master for the submodule and update regularly to ensure that always the latest version is used!

However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters. In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages. Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages. To fulfill this requirement, the \"Page numbering\" extension features were implemented. These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two (\"== \") sections on each page). Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential figure and table numbers. Only pages with the attribute sectnums are considered: set it per page or apply globally/per component All relevant pages are in the navigation tree The following table lists the supported attributes as well as their default values: Attribute Description Default Example numbered_titles De-/activates the automatic numbering of pages and sections in Antora for all pages where \"sectnums\" is set. false numbered_titles: true The ASAM Antora extension, in combination with the 'sectnumsoffset_antora' extension for Asciidoctor, creates sequential page and section numbers in Antora. To use this feature, add numbered_titles: true to the Antora extension configuration. If you want to activate section numbers by default, set the attribute in the site.yml or your component descriptor. If you want to be able to unset it manually per page, do a soft set. The following settings can be made per page. Note that globally set attributes (in site.yml or component descriptor) may overwrite these. For more information on using global and local attributes in Antora, see the official Antora attribute precedence rules. :sectnums: Activate section numbers from this point onward on this page. :sectnums!: Deactivate section numbers from this point onward on this page. :sectnumoffset: Define a manual offset value for the first level 2 section (\"== \") on this page. All following sections will inherit this as well. :titleoffset: Define a manual offset value for the title of the page. In addition to that, some general actions can be added as attributes in the navigation files. :start-level: Defines the level in the bullet point list from which on the sequential numbers are added. By default, this is set to 1, meaning that every item starting with \"*\" or higher will be included. If set to a higher number, page title numbers will only be added from that level onward. For example, if it is set to 3, all bullet points \"\\*\" and \"*\\*\" will be excluded and counting starts with the first element of \"*\\*\\*\". :reset-level-offset: Resets the counter back to the start value. :sectnums!: Deactivate section numbers for the next bullet point. [preface] Disables section and title numbers for the next bullet point in the list and adds the [preface] role to the referenced page, if possible. Note that this has no immediate effect since [preface] is not supported in the document type article that is mandatory for Antora! [appendix] Sets section and title numbers to start with capital letters. Page titles get a prefix of {appendix-caption} {appendix-letter}: `, where `{appendix-caption} is the chosen Asciidoctor appendix caption (default: \"Appendix\") and {appendix-letter} the next available letter in the alphabet for the appendix (start value: \"A\"). [bibliography] Disables section and title numbers for the next bullet point in the list and adds the [bibliography] role to the referenced page, if possible.

To account for that and make tracking changes easier, this versioning concept is applied. The main idea of this concept is to have all officially released versions on main with a tag. Only tagged versions on this branch are displayed - with the exception of this Editing Guide. The current development happens on a branch named \"dev\". This branch is regularly merged back into main. The dev branch is never tagged. If a project, upon request, is granted to create a specific Project Guide variant, the variant’s latest commit is hosted. Project-specific guide variants are separated from the standard Project Guide into a collective Antora component. Each project is displayed as an Antora version. All released versions exist on the branch 'main'. Each new release must be tagged with v.., where , , and are numbers. Version numbers follow the Semantic Versioning rules. Development happens on the branch 'dev'. This branch must be marked as \"prerelease\" during development. No tags may be created on the 'dev' branch. Make sure to remove the prerelease attribute in the antora.yml before merging the dev changes back to main. Alternatively, do not merge the antora.yml. In case project-specific guides are required, a project may request a specific branch for content on the Project Guide. If the request is accepted, the project’s branch name will be 'open-x', where 'x' is the name of the project. Example: project 'OpenNEWSTANDARD' → branch name: 'open-newstandard'. No tags may be created on any project-specific branch. If important changes happen on the main branch that should impact the project as well, these changes shall be cherry-picked. Likewise, if a project concludes, its content is reviewed and approved updates from it shall be cherry-picked onto the 'dev' branch (and later be merged onto the 'main' branch). Antora can take content from different repositories, branches, and/or tags, and combine them in one single generate. In case of the ASAM Project Guide, the generator takes a single content repository and uses its two main folders to generate its content. However, the generator selects only a single branch+version combination from the 'guide' folder. In contrast to that, it takes multiple branches and tags from the 'content' folder. The figure above illustrates the applied mapping: The latest tagged version (in the example: v1.2.1) on the main branch gets the reference name 'latest' automatically All other tagged versions on main are displayed with their tag name The latest commit on main is also used for the \"Editing the ASAM Project Guide\" component The latest commit on the dev branch is used as pre-release version named \"dev\" The latest commit on any open-x branch is used for the corresponding \"version\" of the Specific Project Guide component All content on the branches 'main' and 'dev' use the component asamprojectguide All project-specific branches shall use the component specificguides The following rules are applied using git information: tag with 'v..' → version: x.y.z branch == 'open-*' → version: open* branch == 'dev' → version: dev The following must be specified by the branch maintainer: prerelease for 'dev'-branch (set to true) component name for open* branches (set to specificguides) Branches are not added automatically in Antora. Every branch that the Guide officially supports has to be added in the site.yml. Tags, however, are applied automatically as long as they follow the specified syntax: v.., where , , and are numbers. Example: v1.0.0 To generate the Project Guide, two repositories are used: a generator repository and a content repository. This is displayed in the figure below. Figure 1. Involved repositories in the Project Guide generation The content repository contains, as the name suggests, the content of the Project Guide. The repository mainly consists of two folders, 'content' and 'guide'. 'content' This folder contains all the ASAM Project Guide content. This is where everything intended for project participants and interested ASAM members is located. The generator takes this folder and, depending on the git reference (tag or branch), labels its version automatically. Note that, according to the [Mapping In Antora], the component for project-specific branches has to be specificguides, whereas the standard Guide content is asamprojectguide. 'guide' This folder contains all instructions and information on how to edit and maintain the Project Guide itself, including this page. Only one version of it may ever be available: the latest commit on the branch main or on dev (main by default)!","title":"Project Guide versioning concept","component":"asamprojectguide-editing","version":"latest","name":"02_versioning_concept","url":"/asamprojectguide-editing/latest/structure/02_versioning_concept.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Branching and tagging","hash":"_branching_and_tagging","id":2},{"text":"Mapping in Antora","hash":"_mapping_in_antora","id":3},{"text":"Repositories","hash":"_repositories","id":4},{"text":"Content repository","hash":"_content_repository","id":5}]},"475":{"id":475,"text":"Used keywords In ASAM Project Guide Used keywords In ASAM Project Guide","title":"Keyword list","component":"asamprojectguide-editing","version":"latest","name":"03_keywords-list","url":"/asamprojectguide-editing/latest/structure/03_keywords-list.html","titles":[{"text":"Project Guide","hash":"_project_guide","id":1},{"text":"The Editing component (here)","hash":"_the_editing_component_here","id":2}]},"476":{"id":476,"text":"This page is an automatically generated list of all keywords used throught this Project Guide.
