The role listed at the top of each section is the one responsible for it. DoR stands for Definition of Ready. It describes the requirements an incoming issue must meet. If DoR are specified but not met, the issue is immediately reset to the previous state (including the assignee). DoD stands for Definition of Done. It describes the requirements that must be met for an issue to be allowed to exit this state.

This date marks the point at which the solution can be reviewed and, ideally, accepted for integration. It is important to note that the due date of the solution does not account for integration! Make sure that there is at least 4 weeks of time after the due date to integrate it before any final deadline of the project. ASAM recommends that each issues takes no more than 4 weeks to create a solution for it. This means that issues where the solution is expected to be more complex should be split into multiple smaller ones, each with an expected resolution time of 4 weeks or less. When scheduling an issue, set its due date according to the issue’s estimate. If an issue is split into multiple sub-issues, assign due dates for the issue as well as the sub-issues. In this case, the due date of the issue itself may exceed the 4 week recommendation. However, the sub-issues should then stick to that limit. The workflow contains some generic roles that each project may implement differently. The role \"Workflow Manager\" is an abstract role. Each project decides how and whom to assign it to. Typical examples are: Project Lead Office Responsible Subgroup leads, if available Change Control Board (CCB) representative, if defined Typically, the Workflow Manager is experienced with using remote repositories. The Integrator is responsible for integrating the developed solution into the standard. Their task is to make sure the writing style is kept consistent and the ASAM editorial rules are met. The Integrator may be a service provider tasked with documentation efforts in the project. Alternatively, the Integrator may be the Office Responsible or a member of the project group. The Integration Reviewer is responsible for reviewing the integrated solution created by the Integrator. They may be an individual or a group. Typically, this is also the Workflow Manager. In the case that a project has a defined Change Control Board, it shall take on this role.","title":"Contribution workflow","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"contribution","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/tour_guide/contribution.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Due dates","hash":"_due_dates","id":2},{"text":"Generic roles","hash":"_generic_roles","id":3},{"text":"Workflow Manager","hash":"_workflow_manager","id":4},{"text":"Integrator","hash":"_integrator","id":5},{"text":"Integration Reviewer","hash":"_integration_reviewer","id":6}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Get started with the guided tour.

Simulation ASAM IT infrastructure Remote Repositories provide an integrated working environment and text editor. With these, users can directly create and edit files without having to install tools like Git or Visual Studio Code. The choice of remote repository depends on the project. Most ASAM projects use ASAM’s GitLab instance. If you are unsure which type of remote repository your project is using, ask your ASAM Office Responsible (OR). ASAM recommends looking up specific questions on these platforms and their features in general on their respective online documentation. Before you can get started, you need to create and set up an account for the project’s online repository. Select and follow the respective instructions in the tab view below. Click the tool’s icon on the right to access the online tool directly. GitLab GitHub ASAM GitLab All specification-related documents are stored and updated in the project’s remote (or online) repository. This GitLab instance is hosted and managed directly by ASAM. The OR will create the account and the user must then set it up. The user has activated their repository account and can access the correct project repositories. Account created by the ASAM office. Follow the link in the GitLab account creation email sent by \"GitLab \" to set your password. Log in with your account using the access. You will be prompted to upload an SSH key. See how to setup secure SSH connection for instructions on generating and uploading the SSH keys. This is only required IF you use git locally in addition to GitLab. The \"ASAM SVN\" login is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Ask the ASAM office to support you by creating your GitLab account. Click Forgot your password? and follow the instructions. Ask the ASAM office to grant you the correct rights according to your role in the project. See \"I cannot access my project’s repository\" above. ASAM e.V. on GitHub All specification-related documents are stored and updated in the project’s remote (or online) repository. This GitHub instance is an online service that ASAM uses.

It is initially prepared by the ASAM Office. Each Sharepoint’s start page acts as the main access webpage for the project team. Each project may design their pages differently. The associated ASAM Office Responsible, together with the Project Lead, populates and maintains the Sharepoint’s structure and content. It is the responsibility of each presenter, however, to upload their presentation material. The following image shows an example. Every project at ASAM has its own Microsoft Sharepoint that uses the same base folder structure. It stores documents that are project related but not directly content for the project. Sharepoint also serves as a project’s landing page (webpage) for the group where news are shared, FAQs are hosted, and important links and files can be found.

In ASAM projects, Sharepoint is used to exchange information in the team that is not a direct result or content of development. It consists of a landing page specific to the project. In addition to the landing page and its webpage features (such as FAQs), the main aspect of Sharepoint is its documents storage. Sharepoint can be used to exchange files not directly used as project content (e.g. background information, studies, floor plans for meetings etc.). It also contains the approved project proposal as well as the current participants list. Any content directly relevant to the project’s deliverables (such as images to be used in a standard) are not to be organized through Sharepoint. Instead, such information has to be entered through the project’s repository so that is subjected to the same version control as all the other content. This list may contain sensitive personal data and may, therefore, not be shared with external parties outside the project. Each Sharepoint contains a list of all participants in the related project. This list is set up initially based on the signups during the Proposal phase. However, participation and assignments may change during development. It is the responsibility of the Project Lead to keep this document up to date on at least a monthly basis. They may delegate this task to another project member.

Typically, this is a format description (data structure) or a protocol definition or an API and has the following properties: Platform-independent Technology-independent Supplier-independent Implementation-independent Does not contradict any other ASAM standard These documents is normative by default. They may contain non-normative content as long as it is clearly marked as such. A standard may contain one or more Reference documents. A Reference document contains information related to implementers. The name of each Reference document is prepended by its type or target audience. For example, a Reference for programmers would be named \"Programmers Reference\". This information is non-normative. A standard may contain one or more Guidelines documents. A Guidelines document contains information related to users. The name of each Guidelines document is prepended by its type or target audience. For example, a Guidelines document for modeling scenarios would be named \"Modelling Guidelines\". This information is non-normative. Sometimes, a project’s deliverable does not fit any of the above. In this case, it is considered to be a so-called \"Supplementary\" material. Note that Supplemental material is only allowed if deemed absolutely necessary and if it is neither Specification, Reference, nor Guidelines. The following list contains common examples and is non-exhaustive. If you are unsure if a deliverable is Supplementary material, check with your Office Responsible. Model files typically contain the object model of the standard. A typical example of a model file in ASAM standards are UML models created with the tool \"Enterprise Architect\" (.ea). Schema files define the formal structure and syntax of text files. They are used for automated schema validation. Typical examples of schema files are XML definition files (.xsd) or Google protocol buffers definition files (.proto). Interface definition files define programmatic interfaces, such as APIs (Application Programming Interface). They are used for automatic code generation of the standardized interface for specific programming languages. A typical example of an interface definition file is the Interface Description Language file (.idl). Example files demonstrate a typical and standard-compliant implementation of the standard.","title":"ASAM Deliverables","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"deliverables","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Concepts/deliverables.html","titles":[{"text":"Standard documents","hash":"_standard_documents","id":1},{"text":"Specification","hash":"_specification","id":2},{"text":"Reference","hash":"_reference","id":3},{"text":"Guidelines","hash":"_guidelines","id":4},{"text":"Supplemental material","hash":"_supplemental_material","id":5},{"text":"Model files","hash":"_model_files","id":6},{"text":"Schema files","hash":"_schema_files","id":7},{"text":"Interface definition files","hash":"_interface_definition_files","id":8},{"text":"Example files","hash":"_example_files","id":9}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Many newer projects at ASAM follow the concept of Documentation as Code (Doc-as-Code). This concept refers to using the same tools and methods for documentation (or standardization) as for writing (software) code. The main benefit of this concept is the separation of content and text in documents from its layout rules and publishing. The general concept is to use established tools and processes from software development and apply them in the creation of documents. At ASAM, the main aspects of this concept are: Writing documents in plain text markup Using repositories with version control systems Collaborating on projects through online repository platforms Automation of repetitive steps using automation pipelines The first aspect of this concept is the usage of plain text documents with a semantic markup language in creating standards and other documents, particularly the free AsciiDoc format. Its main benefit is the separation of content from style and layout rules, making it possible to specify general layout settings in a separate set of files and instructions for consistency over multiple projects. Another benefit is that AsciiDoc files can be opened and edited with any type of text editor, making it a platform-agnostic format. Different people can write content independent of the operating system on their work devices and without requiring specific software licenses. Additionally, plain text files work especially well with respositories and version control systems. They provide tools for viewing changes, making collaboration particularly easy. Finally, the content is decoupled from the target output, making it simple to generate different types of documentation from the same source files if needed. AsciiDoc source file Rendered output Figure 1. ASAM Foreword section in AsciiDoc (source) Figure 2. The same Foreword section rendered by Asciidoctor and Antora in HTML (rich output) Using tool-supported document versioning is another main aspect in the Doc-as-Code approach. ASAM projects frequently use the software Git for this purpose. It allows for working on different parts, features, or versions of a project separately. With Git, all of these can be merged again later. Content is stored in so-called repositories. Each repository consist of one or more branches. At ASAM, there usually is one main branch (called \"main\" or (outdated) \"master\") and possibly one or more feature branches. The central branch (also called the \"trunk\") acts as the agreed or released \"official\" state of the repository. When changes need to be made, they are added through branches created from this trunk. Each child branch targets a single aspect of development. Once the development in a child branch has advanced enough, its changes are merged back into the trunk. This is done through a so-called Merge Request (MR), sometimes also called a Pull Request (PR). Figure 3. Repository workflow and branching example. If you want to learn more about Git itself, ASAM recommends online introductions and tutorials such as this one. The work on standards, particularly at ASAM, is of collaborative nature: People from different companies join in a project to develop something together. Online repository platforms like GitLab and GitHub support the collaboration by providing features for commenting and reviewing content changes as well as issue boards for creating and tracking topics. In addition to that, they also integrate the same versioning and repository aspects described in the section above. Using online collaboration platforms with repository support has multiple benefits: They typically provide online editors for content, so users can choose to participate in projects without having to install software (besides any standard web browser) Merge Requests (Pull Requests) can be reviewed and commented on with a side-by-side preview in the browser (diff view) They act as central repository location for the project(s) that can be accessed from anywhere (provided the user has sufficient rights), so all involved people always have access to the latest submitted changes They enable central automation steps through CI/CD pipelines, for example automated writing rules checks on a document after it was updated They provide integrated issue boards for keeping track of tasks, found problems, discussion topics, etc. The figure below shows an example issue from a project where a topic discussion takes place. Figure 4. Example for a topic discussion through the GitLab issue board in a project ASAM currently supports projects on both its internal GitLab instance as well as on the public GitHub. Unless explicitly decided differently by the Office, new projects use GitLab. Pipelines in online repositories allow to automate repetitive steps, such as building a document and checking for structural and grammatical errors. ASAM projects typically automate the following steps: Convert AsciiDoc files to html using Asciidoctor or Antora Linting and testing documents for rules defined in the ASAM editorial guide and returning found errors Publishing results as pipeline artifacts for downloads or distribution Running project-specific scripts for additional features, such as converting UML diagrams to AsciiDoc files These pipeline instructions are stored in text files in each repository. In GitLab, they are stored as .gitlab-ci.yml. In GitHub, they are stored as \"workflows\" under .github/workflows. In both cases, the file is written in \"YAML\". If you want to learn more about pipelines, see the GitLab CI documentation or the GiHub blog.","title":"Documentation as Code","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"doc-as-code","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Concepts/doc-as-code.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Concept","hash":"_concept","id":2},{"text":"Plain text content files","hash":"sec-plain-text-markup","id":3},{"text":"Versioning and repositories","hash":"sec-versioning-repo","id":4},{"text":"Online collaboration","hash":"sec-online-collaboration","id":5},{"text":"Automation pipelines","hash":"sec-automation-pipeline","id":6}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"There are three types: Contributor (aka active participation) Spectator (aka passive participation) Reviewer (renamed, renamed, previously used member / active member) A participant in an ASAM project that has committed resources to contributing to the project.

Not all projects must necessarily pass through all these phases. See the phase descriptions below for more details. Figure 1. The ASAM Project Phases. The icons are explained in the project types Ideation Proposal Development Review Release Purpose To decide whether an idea for a project is promising. Required for Any project not directly based on a previous project. Timeline No standard timeline If someone has an idea for a new standard, it triggers the ideation phase for a new project. During this phase, the idea is evaluated and fleshed out a bit until it is either discarded (e.g. it is not feasible or a duplicate of sorts) or accepted by ASAM. In case the idea is accepted, the project moves on to the Proposal Phase. The Ideation Phase is a phase of variable length. It may contain an Ideation Workshop where the idea is first developed together with ASAM and interested members before it is deemed promising enough to enter the next phase. Purpose To define participants and funding for a project and decide whether to proceed. Required for Every project type. Timeline The typical Proposal Phase timeline consists of Whether a project idea was just accepted or a new project is proposed based on a released concept paper or as an improvement of an existing standard, it enters the Proposal Phase. During this phase, the proposed project is announced and then presented to interested parties, who can sign up to join the project team if it is approved by the TSC. A Proposal document is written, detailing the project’s targets, participants, the budget, timeline, and other project-related information, such as the type of the project. The Proposal document is then released to attract more attention as well as for transparency. It is also the basis for the ASAM TSC, which decides if the project may continue or not. If the go-ahead is given, the project continues on to the Development phase. The group may decide to do more than one Proposal Workshop. In this case, enrollment starts after the last workshop and proposal submission is due 4-8 weeks after that date. Purpose To develop the project’s deliverables. Required for Every project type. Timeline The length of the Development Phase varies from project to project. However, most projects' proposed development duration lies between 6 and 18 months. This is the main phase of each project. If you want to learn more about how to get ready for your project, check out the Guided tour. During this phase, the project-type specific deliverables are developed by the project participants. In the beginning, the project team organizes a workshop to specify their modus operandi and set up all technical aspects of the project. In particular, the Project Lead who is the main responsible for the project is elected. Depending on the size of the project, other roles such as Subgroup Leads are also elected. Additionally, the group may also employ one or more Service Providers as outside help if the required budget was included in the Proposal document. This is followed by specifying, writing, and reviewing content internally until the document or documents are ready for a ASAM-internal or public review in the Review Phase. The requirements for \"ready\" can be found under the 'Review' tab. The project group can (and should!) review their changes regularly during development. The Review phase is a dedicated \"final\" review phase before publication. During development, the project team has regular group meetings. ASAM recommends a 2 month interval for these larger meetings. In between, the group (and its optional subgroups) works on the parts of the project they prioritized for this interval. During development, the project group will meet in multiple different types of meetings not depicted here. For example, a project with subgroups will have individual subgroup meetings for each of them within each development interval. For more on the types of meetings during a project’s development, see Project meetings in the Guided tour. Purpose To review the developed deliverables. Required for Major Version Update Minor Version Update Timeline The typical Review Phase timeline looks like this: Figure 2. The Review phase timeline Before a developed standard is officially released, the created deliverables have to be reviewed. Depending on the project, these reviews may be available to ASAM members only, open to the general public, or a mixture of both. Any problems that are identified during any of these reviews are then analyzed and categorized. Important fixes have to be made before the deliverables are released, whilst improvements beyond the initial scope or minute details may be put off for future iterations. Once the document has been successfully reviewed and no critical issues are open anymore, the project continues on to the Release Phase. In order to be allowed to enter the Review phase, the group must ensure the following requirements are met: All deliverables of the standard shall be feature-complete, i.e. the specification or revision of all features of the standard has been finished. A partial review of a deliverable (where the deliverable is incomplete) is prohibited! The project group members determine whether the standard is ready for the review phase. The project group can (and should!) review their changes regularly during development. The Review phase is a dedicated \"final\" review phase before publication. The Review phase contains of at least two review periods: one group review period and one review period with reviewers outside the group. The group review may be skipped entirely if the group can provide good reasons for doing so. In this case, it must get approval from the ASAM Office Responsible, the Project Lead, and the ASAM CTO first. There are two types of reviews outside the group: ASAM member reviews (default) Public reviews The Office may restrict the group of reviewers in agreement with the project group members or as per TSC decision. After each review period, all feedback must be reviewed and the group must make a decision on how to proceed with it. The decision includes as a minimum the status \"accepted\", \"rejected\" or \"deferred\". The decision must be documented. The group may start reviewing the feedback before the end of the respective review period. However, it may not extend into the next period. Accepted feedback shall be implemented. The project group has full authority how to implement the reviewers' feedback into the standard. They can implement changes as proposed by the reviewer, or decide for a different implementation. Reviewers should not submit new use-cases, features, or requirements as part of their review feedback. If a reviewer’s feedback is actually out-of-scope, since it contains a request to consider a new use-case, feature or requirement, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the ASAM CR-system with status \"new\". Both the group review and the review outside the group may be repeated if major changes had to be implemented based on the provided feedback. Purpose To release the developed deliverables. Required for Every project type. Timeline The typical Release Phase timeline looks like this: Figure 3. The Release phase timeline After the deliverables have been developed (and, in case of a major or minor standard development project, successfully reviewed), the project enters the Release Phase. The project group prepares a release candidate and agrees per formal voting to submit the candidate to the TSC for release decision. The release candidate has to be accepted by absolute two-thirds majority for it to pass. The Project Leader submits the following deliverables to ASAM: the standard with all supplemental documents, files and examples that constitute the deliverables to members sources required to generate the deliverables, including written instructions how to generate them revision history documentation (not needed for version 1.0.0) a (new) release presentation (Sources are those digital work products, which can be modified or edited with standard tools such as text editors, image processors or modeling tools, and which are the input for generators that produce the final deliverables.) The release candidate has to be submitted at least two (2) weeks prior to the next TSC meeting. For a development project, this also requires that the Review Phase has been passed without any critical issues still open. The project has now concluded.","title":"Project phases","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"project_phases","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Concepts/project_phases.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Descriptions","hash":"_descriptions","id":2}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"ASAM developes its products and results in projects. Different result types require different approaches and conditions. For this reason, ASAM defines four project types, which further characterize the work to be done within the projects. Figure 1. ASAM project types overview A new project can be triggered by either a new idea, a previous Concept Paper, or a previously released Standard. The intended output of each project type is a document. For a Concept project, the output is a Concept Paper (which can be the basis for a follow-up project) For a Standard Development project, the output is the standard + optional supplemental documents For a Study project, the output is a Study Report that details the findings of the project. For an Implementation project, the output is TODO. Note that a new concept project is usually not triggered by a previous one. Concept Standard development Study Implementation Description Concept projects have the purpose to prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards. They are typically chosen when the envisioned standard is complex and requires significant resources to even develop a sound and solid project proposal. Goal The goals of concept projects are to propose specific content for ASAM standards and/or to provide justification for the usefulness, practicability, and feasibility of the proposed content. Repository suffix Concept Output Concept Paper Description Standard development projects are the core of ASAM. In these, the project group defines the content of an ASAM standard (new or updated). In accordance with the concept of semantic versioning, a standard development project may be one of the following: Major Major version developments of ASAM standards introduce significant (i.e. compatibility breaking) changes to the standard. A completely new standard is also considered to be a major version development. The number of major version releases meets the pattern: \"X.0.0\". Minor Minor version developments of ASAM standards introduce significant feature changes that do not break backwards compatibility. The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: \"Y.X.0\". Maintenance Maintenance version developments of ASAM standards resolve technical issues of the standard. Examples are correcting errors, removing ambiguities, adding clarifications to existing descriptions, making editorial improvements, or changing examples. Maintenance versions may not introduce new features. The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: \"Z.Y.X\". Goal The goal is to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. Repository suffix Standard Output Standard and (optionally) supplemental material All variants use the same repository suffix. Description Study projects provide members, an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards in a collaborative way. Goal These projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards, to promote their application in member companies, and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards. This project type is specifically intended for members in regions, where ASAM standards are not well known. Repository suffix Study Output Study Report Description Implementation projects have the purpose to create a supplementary product to a standard that supports the implementation or application of an ASAM standard in the industry. Goal The goal of an implementation project is to create a tool or source code, such as checkers for file formats and APIs, add-ons or plug-ins for commonly used IDEs, importers, exporters or reference implementations. Promoting specific commercial tools shall be avoided.

Each of these roles has their own set of requirements, mandatory and/or optional tool, guidelines and how-tos, some of them shared between multiple roles. Figure 1. Overview over the most relevant roles in ASAM projects. It is possible to have more than one role at the same time. Some roles require you to \"enroll\" in a project first. Enrollment requires an ASAM membership. The following table contains a list of the most prominent roles at ASAM and a short description for each of them. (1) Someone who has access to and possibly is an active user of any ASAM standard. Some standards require ASAM membership in order to access the documents, whilst other standards are available to anyone online. The role Standard User is not directly involved in the creation of a standard. However, a Standard User may take over other (active) roles in a project by enrolling in it. Note that project participation also requires ASAM membership! (2) A Standard User that participates in the review of one or more documents. They are considered non-enrolled Reviewers. When a project’s deliverables are reviewed, ASAM members who were not involved in the project directly can participate in the Review phase by becoming a Reviewer and providing feedback. In case the project has a public review, ASAM membership is not required. ASAM members can also enroll specifically as Reviewers for projects. In this case, they become a participant that has committed a small amount of resources to support the project team with review focused activities. This may include review of merge requests, proposals and/or review of documents. The following points are related to such enrolled reviewers: Company being represented must be an ASAM Member Has committed resources for review Has access to the Sharepoint Has reporter access to the project Gitlab (3) An ASAM member participating in an ASAM project. Each project consists of multiple Project Participants. There are two different types of project participants: contributors and spectators. Contributor (renamed, renamed, previously used member / active member) A participant in an ASAM project that has committed resources to contributing to the project. They typically work in one or more subgroups, each focussing on a specific aspect of the project. The company being represented must be an ASAM Member Has committed resources Has access to the project Sharepoint Has developer access to the project GitLab Each company with at least one contributor has one vote Spectator Passive participant or observer in an ASAM project that is part of a company with at least one contributor in the project. The company being represented must be an ASAM Member Has access to the project Sharepoint Has reporter access to the project Gitlab (4) The Project Participant responsible for the project and leading the general project activities. Every project needs one elected Project Lead who takes responsibility for it. The Project Lead is elected at the beginning of the Development Phase. Any Project Participant can send in their candidacy during the Proposal Phase. (5) An active Project Participant leading the activities of a subgroup. Many projects divide up their activities into so-called subgroups which focus on specific aspects of a project. Each of these groups may be led by a Subgroup Lead. (6) A subgroup of experts from the project taking on this optional and additional role. The Change Control Board (CCB) is responsible for internal alignment of topics, release management and approval/review of pull requests: Issue and MR/PR review Classification of issues Assignment of issues to solution developer(s) Milestone monitoring and planning Ensure alignment of individual Subgroup topics Release management Commitment to the CCB is for the duration of a project. Average commitment entails 1-2 hour meetings every 2 weeks during active development and offline review of content. (7) ASAM contact of the project. An Office Responsible (OR) is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project. (8) Editor and writing support. A Technical Writer supports the creation of documents. They ensure ASAM’s Editorial Guide is applied and the document is formalized. (9) Committee at ASAM reviewing a project’s state.

Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where. Figure 1. Creating an issue from a template The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently. Each issue and merge/pull request must apply general domain labels defined by ASAM. A project may also have project-specific labels in addition to the default ones, specified directly in the project group. A group may introduce project-specific labels on top of the official ASAM ones that provide further filter options. If custom labels are introduced, the group must document these labels by providing a exhaustive label description with the label (i.e. in the GitLab/GitHub label). Additionally, the project may add the current label definitions in their project’s README in their repository. The documentation shall follow the project’s general documentation rules and language. The content of issues is discussed and resolved through comments and replies to previous comments. Content Comments Replies The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue. In the case of a feature, it contains the proposed content/change. In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic. A comment to an issue is a new topic that is independent from any previous comment. A user comments on the issue to partake in the discussion of this topic.

This date marks the point at which the solution can be reviewed and, ideally, accepted for integration. It is important to note that the due date of the solution does not account for integration! Make sure that there is at least 4 weeks of time after the due date to integrate it before any final deadline of the project. ASAM recommends that each issues takes no more than 4 weeks to create a solution for it. This means that issues where the solution is expected to be more complex should be split into multiple smaller ones, each with an expected resolution time of 4 weeks or less. When scheduling an issue, set its due date according to the issue’s estimate. If an issue is split into multiple sub-issues, assign due dates for the issue as well as the sub-issues. In this case, the due date of the issue itself may exceed the 4 week recommendation. However, the sub-issues should then stick to that limit. The workflow contains some generic roles that each project may implement differently. The role \"Workflow Manager\" is an abstract role. Each project decides how and whom to assign it to. Typical examples are: Project Lead Office Responsible Subgroup leads, if available Change Control Board (CCB) representative, if defined Typically, the Workflow Manager is experienced with using remote repositories. The Integrator is responsible for integrating the developed solution into the standard. Their task is to make sure the writing style is kept consistent and the ASAM editorial rules are met. The Integrator may be a service provider tasked with documentation efforts in the project. Alternatively, the Integrator may be the Office Responsible or a member of the project group. The Integration Reviewer is responsible for reviewing the integrated solution created by the Integrator. They may be an individual or a group. Typically, this is also the Workflow Manager. In the case that a project has a defined Change Control Board, it shall take on this role.","title":"Contribution workflow","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"contribution","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Project%20guidelines/contribution.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Due dates","hash":"_due_dates","id":2},{"text":"Generic roles","hash":"_generic_roles","id":3},{"text":"Workflow Manager","hash":"_workflow_manager","id":4},{"text":"Integrator","hash":"_integrator","id":5},{"text":"Integration Reviewer","hash":"_integration_reviewer","id":6}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"Participants of a meeting can make decisions on topics within the scope of their respective group.

Project-level Can make decisions on all topics that affect the whole project or parts thereof within the defined project scope. May prepare suggestions for topics that alter the current scope or affect other projects as well. These suggestions, however, must be escalated to the appropriate ASAM-level meeting. Subgroups Can make decisions on all topics assigned to this particular subgroup. May prepare suggestions for topics that affect other subgroups. However, topics that go beyond the subgroup’s responsibilities must be escalated to the whole group. A topic must be presented at the next project-level meeting when: Changes to the underlying data model It is requested by the Subgroup It is requested by the Project Lead It is requested by a project steering committee (e.g. the CCB) The subgroup cannot reach a decision on a specific topic or assumes that there are different opinions in the overall project group The Project Lead may escalate Subgroup decisions to a project level vote. If a project cannot meet its milestones or budget, it must escalate its status report in the next relevant ASAM-level meeting (such as the TSC controlling meeting). An inactive participant is someone who is registered as an active participant but repeatedly does not partake in meetings or any development activities. It is up to the project to decide when a participant is considered inactive. As an example, a group can decide that three (3) unexcused absences are the limit, with a final warning being issued after the second time. Inactive participants can hinder a project by bringing it below the required voting threshold. They also put more workload on the other active members. Lastly, inactive participants endanger the project’s budget. It is, therefore, important to identify inactive members quickly and get them to be active again. As a last resort, inactive (and possibly unresponsive) members can be removed from the project. This is the responsibility of the responsible lead: Project Lead for project level inactiveness, Subgroup Lead for relevant subgroups.","title":"Decisions and escalations","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"decisions_and_escalations","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/compendium/Project%20guidelines/decisions_and_escalations.html","titles":[{"text":"Decisions in meetings","hash":"_decisions_in_meetings","id":1},{"text":"Escalation of topics","hash":"_escalation_of_topics","id":2},{"text":"From Subgroup to group","hash":"_from_subgroup_to_group","id":3},{"text":"From group to ASAM-level meeting","hash":"_from_group_to_asam_level_meeting","id":4},{"text":"Inactive participants","hash":"_inactive_participants","id":5}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"This page contains guidelines regarding all types of official meetings at ASAM.

These are considered official meetings in this context. Clarification or co-development calls as well as similar informal types of meetings do not have to follow these guidelines. They still may if they wish, of course. If you are hosting an official meeting, make sure to familiarize yourself with them ahead of time. An official meeting will not take place unless a minute taker is defined in advance! Project meetings are set up by the ASAM office, even when they are not the meeting host. All other meetings within a project (such as Subgroup meetings) have to be set up by the respective host. Every meeting has a host. This is the person who calls the meeting. The host has the following responsibilities: Define the minute taker. They can take that role themselves if they wish. If not, the assignee has to agree to this task first. Provide the agenda for the meeting Set up the meeting and send out the invites (exception: project meetings are set up by the ASAM office in coordination with the host) Moderate the meeting Ensure to stay within the defined timetable If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants (assignees) Ensure that minutes are taken and send out the link to them afterwards Follow up with assignees on assigned tasks after the meeting The minute taker is designated by the meeting host. This may be the host themselves. However, the host may not just appoint role to a project member without their consent. The order of responsibility regarding the taking of minutes is as follows: Host (since they usually do not need to travel) Service Provider Project Lead Office Responsible The minute taker has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Create the meeting notes document ahead of time Add the provided agenda to the meeting notes During the meeting Document the participants as well as missing meeting members Take notes during the meeting Document all assigned tasks with their assignees Add provided links and documents After the meeting Request missing documents and links from the responsible participants Update the notes with delivered updates (e.g. links to files) Finalize the notes once everything has been provided Inform the host in case of overdue tasks The host of the meeting is responsible for providing a meeting agenda ahead of time. The agenda must be shared in the invite to the meeting. The agenda also has to be included in the meeting notes. Each agenda must at least have the following contents: Antitrust Reminder scheduled votes for the meeting documentation of participants voting template agenda items The target audience depends on your meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. Never work on the trunk directly — always work in separate branches! The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Tags are used to identify fixed states of the repository, including official releases and other versions where the project deems it necessary. Version-based tags use semantic versioning. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived (<2 weeks) and regularly merged back. These branches MAY be squashed and MUST be merged via fast-forward merge (enabled by default). Once an issue can be implemented, the issue’s assignee creates a branch with an associated Merge or Pull Request from the issue. Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches. Begin submitting work via commits to the branch. Involved project participants review and comment changes through the associated Pull/Merge Request. These comments work identically to those described in \"discuss issues\". Review implementation progress of issue with other project participants in Subgroup or project meetings. Discussions and their results are documented in the Pull/Merge Request Once the group agrees that the feature is complete, the issue state transitions to isState:Implemented. If the Merge/Pull Request is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Tips If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident.

Relationship between meeting types Each project at ASAM is also part of an overarching project coordination. This coordination includes different monitoring and steering meetings. It is the Project Lead’s responsibility to represent their project in those meetings. These are the top level controlling meetings at ASAM, where the TSC reviews all current projects. Here, projects can request more time as well as submit their deliverables for review and, ideally, approval for release. In case a project faces unforeseen problems and setbacks, these are addressed here. Upcoming TSC meetings are announced on the ASAM website. If you are interested, the ASAM Website provides some more information on the whole development process. Check out the Development Process page. If you have additional questions, don’t hesitate to contact your ASAM representative. A project-level meeting is declared as such when all enrolled project members are invited to participate. The most common examples for these meetings are the Kick-off Workshop status meetings review meetings If possible, project-level meetings are to be held face-to-face or as hybrid. If circumstances forbid this, online meetings are acceptable as well. ASAM requires projects to hold a project-level meeting at least once a quarter. The recommendation is to meet every two months. A full project meeting is used to hold project level votes, align across Subgroups and evaluate the overall status with respect to the project plan. Every subgroup will schedule their own meetings. Typically, these meetings happen more frequently than the larger project-level meetings. Here, the subgroups discuss progress, setbacks, and current topics within their assignment and make related decisions.

Please ensure familiarity with these rules prior to participating in a project voting. An ASAM Office Responsible will reference these rules prior to the initiation of project votes in any meeting. By default, discussion topics where every participant agrees do not require any voting. Every project member may request that a topic be voted on. Additionally, the meeting host may set up a quick poll first to identify topics that require a formal voting. Project-level or subgroup votings take place during meetings. Their results must be made available in the corresponding meeting notes. By default, votings are announced in the agenda (before a meeting takes place). However, if spontaneous topics arise, ad hoc votings can be held if all impacted participants are present. In the case that one or more crucial members for a topic’s ad hoc voting are missing, the voting must be postponed and scheduled for the next meeting. A voting is only valid if at least 50% of registered active (sub-)group members cast their vote and the Issue Responsible (if defined) is present. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. A passive participant (someone not involved in the development directly, such as a spectator or a reviewer) is neither considered for this threshold nor may they participate in any votings. Note that substantial changes (e.g., to a data model) being proposed by a subgroup must be presented to and approved by the full project. To be eligible to vote, a member must have been present during the corresponding topic discussion/presentation. The only exception to this is voting for topics of static nature, such as meeting frequencies. As mentioned above, a passive participant may not vote. In a voting, each member company has one vote, votes cannot be transferred to other companies. It is strongly recommended that if a company has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a company casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally) and their votes conflict, their vote is counted as abstention. Choices can be voting-specific (for example if the project is deciding between two or more options). Abstention is a valid vote. For approval votes, the choices are yes, no, abstention. Voting is decided by simple majority of yes/no votes (abstentions do not count). The exception to this rule is a project release vote prior to submission to the ASAM TSC. For such a vote a two-thirds majority is needed. All votes must be cast digitally and through an online tool (so both onsite and remote users can vote). You can ask your ASAM Office Responsible for support on creating such a vote ahead of time. Some topics require a formal voting. These typically address project phase changes or things like release decisions.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. Never work on the trunk directly — always work in separate branches! The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Tags are used to identify fixed states of the repository, including official releases and other versions where the project deems it necessary. Version-based tags use semantic versioning. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived (<2 weeks) and regularly merged back. These branches MAY be squashed and MUST be merged via fast-forward merge (enabled by default). Once an issue can be implemented, the issue’s assignee creates a branch with an associated Merge or Pull Request from the issue. Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches. Begin submitting work via commits to the branch. Involved project participants review and comment changes through the associated Pull/Merge Request. These comments work identically to those described in \"discuss issues\". Review implementation progress of issue with other project participants in Subgroup or project meetings. Discussions and their results are documented in the Pull/Merge Request Once the group agrees that the feature is complete, the issue state transitions to isState:Implemented. If the Merge/Pull Request is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Tips If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident.

If a project cannot meet its milestones or budget, it must escalate its status report in the next relevant ASAM-level meeting (such as the TSC controlling meeting). An inactive participant is someone who is registered as an active participant but repeatedly does not partake in meetings or any development activities. It is up to the project to decide when a participant is considered inactive. As an example, a group can decide that three (3) unexcused absences are the limit, with a final warning being issued after the second time. Inactive participants can hinder a project by bringing it below the required voting threshold. They also put more workload on the other active members. Lastly, inactive participants endanger the project’s budget. It is, therefore, important to identify inactive members quickly and get them to be active again. As a last resort, inactive (and possibly unresponsive) members can be removed from the project.

These are considered official meetings in this context. Clarification or co-development calls as well as similar informal types of meetings do not have to follow these guidelines. They still may if they wish, of course. If you are hosting an official meeting, make sure to familiarize yourself with them ahead of time. An official meeting will not take place unless a minute taker is defined in advance! Project meetings are set up by the ASAM office, even when they are not the meeting host. All other meetings within a project (such as Subgroup meetings) have to be set up by the respective host. Every meeting has a host. This is the person who calls the meeting. The host has the following responsibilities: Define the minute taker. They can take that role themselves if they wish. If not, the assignee has to agree to this task first. Provide the agenda for the meeting Set up the meeting and send out the invites (exception: project meetings are set up by the ASAM office in coordination with the host) Moderate the meeting Ensure to stay within the defined timetable If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants (assignees) Ensure that minutes are taken and send out the link to them afterwards Follow up with assignees on assigned tasks after the meeting The minute taker is designated by the meeting host.

The agenda must be shared in the invite to the meeting. The agenda also has to be included in the meeting notes. Each agenda must at least have the following contents: Antitrust Reminder scheduled votes for the meeting documentation of participants voting template agenda items The target audience depends on your meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR.

Please ensure familiarity with these rules prior to participating in a project voting. An ASAM Office Responsible will reference these rules prior to the initiation of project votes in any meeting. By default, discussion topics where every participant agrees do not require any voting. Every project member may request that a topic be voted on. Additionally, the meeting host may set up a quick poll first to identify topics that require a formal voting. Project-level or subgroup votings take place during meetings. Their results must be made available in the corresponding meeting notes. By default, votings are announced in the agenda (before a meeting takes place). However, if spontaneous topics arise, ad hoc votings can be held if all impacted participants are present. In the case that one or more crucial members for a topic’s ad hoc voting are missing, the voting must be postponed and scheduled for the next meeting. A voting is only valid if at least 50% of registered active (sub-)group members cast their vote and the Issue Responsible (if defined) is present. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. A passive participant (someone not involved in the development directly, such as a spectator or a reviewer) is neither considered for this threshold nor may they participate in any votings. Note that substantial changes (e.g., to a data model) being proposed by a subgroup must be presented to and approved by the full project. To be eligible to vote, a member must have been present during the corresponding topic discussion/presentation. The only exception to this is voting for topics of static nature, such as meeting frequencies. As mentioned above, a passive participant may not vote. In a voting, each member company has one vote, votes cannot be transferred to other companies. It is strongly recommended that if a company has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a company casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally) and their votes conflict, their vote is counted as abstention. Choices can be voting-specific (for example if the project is deciding between two or more options). Abstention is a valid vote. For approval votes, the choices are yes, no, abstention. Voting is decided by simple majority of yes/no votes (abstentions do not count). The exception to this rule is a project release vote prior to submission to the ASAM TSC. For such a vote a two-thirds majority is needed. All votes must be cast digitally and through an online tool (so both onsite and remote users can vote). You can ask your ASAM Office Responsible for support on creating such a vote ahead of time. Some topics require a formal voting. These typically address project phase changes or things like release decisions. The following items must be subjected to mandatory votings: Election of Project Lead Changes of project scope Budget request Evaluation of service providers Significant changes to deliverables (e.g. within a subgroup) Escalation of topics to TSC Release decision","title":"ASAM project voting guidelines","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"latest","name":"polls_votes","url":"/asamprojectguide/latest/tour_guide/meetings/polls_votes.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"When to conduct votings","hash":"_when_to_conduct_votings","id":2},{"text":"About voting","hash":"_about_voting","id":3},{"text":"Mandatory votings","hash":"_mandatory_votings","id":4}]},"42":{"id":42,"text":"There are three different types of meetings: ASAM-level meetings Coordination within ASAM between multiple projects as well as the with the organization itself Project-level meetings Coordination for the whole project and general project discussions Subgroup meetings Coordination within a subgroup of a project Figure 1. Relationship between meeting types Each project at ASAM is also part of an overarching project coordination. This coordination includes different monitoring and steering meetings. It is the Project Lead’s responsibility to represent their project in those meetings. These are the top level controlling meetings at ASAM, where the TSC reviews all current projects. Here, projects can request more time as well as submit their deliverables for review and, ideally, approval for release. In case a project faces unforeseen problems and setbacks, these are addressed here. Upcoming TSC meetings are announced on the ASAM website. If you are interested, the ASAM Website provides some more information on the whole development process. Check out the Development Process page. If you have additional questions, don’t hesitate to contact your ASAM representative. A project-level meeting is declared as such when all enrolled project members are invited to participate. The most common examples for these meetings are the Kick-off Workshop status meetings review meetings If possible, project-level meetings are to be held face-to-face or as hybrid. If circumstances forbid this, online meetings are acceptable as well. ASAM requires projects to hold a project-level meeting at least once a quarter. The recommendation is to meet every two months. A full project meeting is used to hold project level votes, align across Subgroups and evaluate the overall status with respect to the project plan. Every subgroup will schedule their own meetings. Typically, these meetings happen more frequently than the larger project-level meetings. Here, the subgroups discuss progress, setbacks, and current topics within their assignment and make related decisions.

Entering a passphrase is optional and leads to additional steps every time you connect to the remote, so it is not recommended. Add the generated SSH public key to your GitLab account by following these instructions. Verify that you can connect If you cannot click Next, make sure Visual Studio Code is already installed. Return to the previous step and continue again. Now, the Next button should be active. Make sure that the ssh-agent is running: Open a shell or terminal window Type the following command, hit Enter, and check the status: Get-Service ssh-agent If the status is \"Stopped\", type the following, hit Enter, and check the StartType. Get-Service ssh-agent | Select StartType If the StartType is \"Disabled\", activate the SSH Agent. See My SSH agent is deactivated. Continue here after your SSH agent has bee activated. Enter the following command and hit Enter Start-Service ssh-agent This requires administration rights. If you do not have these, request support from your IT department. Open a shell or terminal window with Administration rights Set the SSH Agent to start manually by typing the following command and hitting Enter: Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual This cannot be done in the Administration terminal window if your Admin account is not your user account! Otherwise, Windows will complain about unprotected private key files!

Commit staged files to your local repo (git commit). Push to a remote repository (git push). https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial A Merge or Pull Requests (MRs) are the way you merge content changes from a development or feature branch back into the trunk or another branch. They provide the project team the opportunity to review changes before they are applied and made public/official. History of commits in a MR must be clean prior to merge ASAM repositories allow fast-forward merges only (--ff-only) and squash commits by default. This means commits do not have to be merged manually and all commits are squashed automatically. For squash commits with one commit, the commit message is taken directly (squash does not take place). For actual squashes the commit messages are taken from: The first multi-line commit message in the merge. The merge request’s title if no multi-line commit message is found. Squash commits is enabled by default but can be turned off. This is to make sure that in case multiple unrelated changes occurred in one branch, they can still be all added to the history. Merge/Pull Requests are reviewed by the project team in sequential steps. A merge conflict occurs when multiple different changes (usually made by different users) are to be merged and some or all of the changes contradict each other. For example, if user A deletes a section in their copy and user B adds a new paragraph to it instead, the merging tool does not know whether to keep the section and add the changes made by user B or to delete it like user A did. One way of avoiding merge conflicts is to keep the TTL (time to live) of branches short. ASAM recommends a TTL of ⇐ 2 weeks. If the branch lives longer than expected, merge the parent branch (the trunk or original feature branch) into your branch once in a while. Alternatively, you can also rebase your branch to the parent branch again. This way you can solve the conflicts in your branch. For more information on the differences between merging and rebasing, see Merging vs. Rebasing. Once you create a merge request, your remote repository will tell you if there are merge conflicts. It leads you through the conflicting parts and lets you choose if your new or the old content is to be merged. Another option is to merge locally. You can use Git or Visual Studio Code for this. These tools also provide options to view conflicting changes and help you resolve them. After you have removed the conflicts, you can create a new commit to your branch that includes the fixes to resolve the conflict in the Merge/Pull Request. For more information, see Git https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts GitLab https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/conflicts.html GitHub https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github This description only covers GitLab.

Each Sharepoint’s start page acts as the main access webpage for the project team. Each project may design their pages differently. The associated ASAM Office Responsible, together with the Project Lead, populates and maintains the Sharepoint’s structure and content. It is the responsibility of each presenter, however, to upload their presentation material. The following image shows an example. Every project at ASAM has its own Microsoft Sharepoint that uses the same base folder structure. It stores documents that are project related but not directly content for the project. Sharepoint also serves as a project’s landing page (webpage) for the group where news are shared, FAQs are hosted, and important links and files can be found.

In ASAM projects, Sharepoint is used to exchange information in the team that is not a direct result or content of development. It consists of a landing page specific to the project. In addition to the landing page and its webpage features (such as FAQs), the main aspect of Sharepoint is its documents storage. Sharepoint can be used to exchange files not directly used as project content (e.g. background information, studies, floor plans for meetings etc.). It also contains the approved project proposal as well as the current participants list. Any content directly relevant to the project’s deliverables (such as images to be used in a standard) are not to be organized through Sharepoint. Instead, such information has to be entered through the project’s repository so that is subjected to the same version control as all the other content. This list may contain sensitive personal data and may, therefore, not be shared with external parties outside the project. Each Sharepoint contains a list of all participants in the related project. This list is set up initially based on the signups during the Proposal phase. However, participation and assignments may change during development. It is the responsibility of the Project Lead to keep this document up to date on at least a monthly basis. They may delegate this task to another project member. When you join a project, make sure that your contact information in the project’s participant list is present, correct, and up-to-date. Figure 2.

This date marks the point at which the solution can be reviewed and, ideally, accepted for integration. ASAM recommends that solution development for issues is scoped to require no more than 4 weeks. This means that issues where the solution is expected to be more complex should be split into multiple smaller ones, each with an expected resolution time of 4 weeks or less. If an issue is split into multiple sub-issues or tasks, assign due dates for the issue as well as the sub-issues. In this case, the due date of the issue itself may exceed the 4 week recommendation.

At a minimum, all projects use: Name Description DevOps platforms ASAM uses both GitHub and GitLab as DevOps platforms. A DevOps platform provides a centralized and integrated environment for development and deployment of ASAM standards. It provides: Issue/ticket-driven workflow Git-based version control for tracking and comparison of changes to files Web-based text editing environment Used to store all source code and content that is part of deliverables of a standard. Issues relevant to deliverables should be created here. Microsoft Sharepoint Microsoft SharePoint is a web-based platform and collaboration tool developed by Microsoft. It serves as a document management and storage system. Used for any content not part of the deliverables of a standard, such as meeting minutes or presentations. Optionally, many of these tools can also be used locally. See Tools for advanced users for more information. Click the tool’s icon on the right to access the online tool directly. DevOps Sharepoint ASAM GitLab The choice of DevOps platform depends on the project. Most ASAM projects use ASAM’s GitLab instance. If you are unsure which type of remote repository your project is using, ask your ASAM Office Responsible (OR). All specification-related documents are stored and updated in the project’s remote (or online) repository. This GitLab instance is hosted and managed directly by ASAM. The OR will create the account and the user must then set it up. The user has activated their repository account and can access the correct project repositories. Account created by the ASAM office. Follow the link in the GitLab account creation email sent by \"GitLab \" to set your password. Log in with your account using the access. You will be prompted to upload an SSH key. See how to setup secure SSH connection for instructions on generating and uploading the SSH keys. This is only required IF you use git locally in addition to GitLab. Ask the OR to support you by creating your GitLab account. Click Forgot your password? and follow the instructions. Ask the OR to grant you the correct rights according to your role in the project. See \"I cannot access my project’s repository\" above. + Sharepoint is used at ASAM to exchange and collaborate on files and documents that are not directly part of the deliverables of a standard. These are files that might not need as strict versioning or where collaboration is preferred on the basis of the Office365 platform. It also serves as the project’s internal landing page. You can access Sharepoint (shared folders) You can add and download files from Sharepoint You have enrolled in the project and provided your email address. The ASAM office sets up the project Sharepoint. If this is your first ASAM project, you will receive an email invitation to join the ASAM Microsoft Organisation. You must accept this invitation to access project pages. On accepting the invitation, you will receive an additional email with a link to the project’s sharepoint. Try navigating to the parent folder and then access the target folder from there again. If this does not work: Check with your ASAM contact if your access to the folder has been revoked or the folder has been renamed. Contact your ASAM Office Responsible and provide them with both your Microsoft account email and your contact email. Make sure to mark each clearly to prevent confusion. The ASAM office will send an invite to your Microsoft account. After you (or your company’s IT) has accepted the invitation, ASAM will change your user email to the other one.

These issues can be created and managed in the respective Remote Repository of the project. It must be possible for every project member to contribute to and give feedback on the topic of discussion directly. For this purpose, all content discussions shall happen through issues in a project’s issue board. This also applies to discussion results from some subgroup meetings. The output of a discussion pertaining to any topic shall be documented in its respective issue. A clean issue contains the following things: active milestone assignee applicable labels If your project is on ASAM GitLab, see the GitLab instructions for creating issues. If your project is on GitHub, see the GitHub instructions for creating issues. Every topic shall have its own issue. If a topic is too complex for a single issue, break it down into smaller parts. This can be either done throuh the use of linked issues or through the creation of tasks, both of which serve the purpose of capturing individual steps needed to complete or close an issue. Issues can be linked to each other in order to make a relationship or dependency visible. See the GitLab documentation. Tasks are a way to capture steps needed to complete/close an issue, they can be separately tracked in Gitlab and make it easier to break down complex issues. See the Gitlab documentation for further details. An open issue with linked related issues shall only be closed if all its linked related issues have been closed. If an issue has a branch, the issue shall not be closed before the branch has been merged or closed. Issues should be created using the provided issue templates in the repository. The issue templates are provided by ASAM and are available by default in the repository. Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where. Figure 1. Creating an issue from a template The use of issue labels is required for filtering and sorting issues more efficiently. Each issue and merge/pull request shall apply workflow relevant state, resolution and type labels as prescribed by the contribution workflow. A project may also define additional labels, for example for further technical categorization of issues. If such labels are introduced, the group shall document these labels by providing an exhaustive description with the label definition. Existing labels as defined in the contribution workflow shall not be replaced or extended. This pertains to type, state and resolution labels. See the label overview for further details. The content of issues is discussed and resolved through comments and replies to previous comments. Content Comments Replies The issue content (body) contains the definition of the issue. In the case of a feature, it contains the proposed content/change. In the case of a question or a bug, it contains the initial topic. A comment to an issue is a new topic that is independent from any previous comment. A user comments on the issue to partake in the discussion of this topic. GitLab GitLab instructions for commenting GitHub GitHub instructions for commenting Before you add a new comment to an issue, make sure it is not a duplicate (i.e. the same or a similar comment already exists) and that it is not supposed to be a reply! Failure to do so will prevent efficient project progress. A reply is a comment created as a reply to a previous comment. It creates a thread. To continue the discussion, reply on the thread. GitLab GitLab instructions for threads/replies GitHub GitHub instructions for communication If you want to reply to a previous comment, make sure to create a reply, not a new comment! An issue shall be closed once its discussion is resolved or the issue has been dismissed. Possible resolutions: The questions of the issue have been answered The bug has been fixed and the fixes have been reviewed and merged The feature has been developed, reviewed, and merged It is best practice to close an issue immediately after one of the closing conditions has been met. Additionally, an issue may also be closed without resolution if it has become obsolete and/or will not be fixed it is a duplicate (i.e. another issue deals with the same topic already) If the topics addressed in a closed issue become relevant again, an issue may be reopened. The reason for reopening the ticket shall be clearly documented in the comments.

A topic must be presented at the next project group meeting if any of the following apply: Changes to the underlying data model are involved It is requested by one or more subgroup participants It is requested by the project lead It is requested by a project steering committee (e.g. the CCB) A consensus-based decision is not feasible or possible If a project wishes to change its scope or timeline or requires a change to budget it should submit to the TSC for a decision. Prior to submitting to the TSC, project consensus on the request being submitted is required. See the TSC Guidelines for guidance on submission. In some cases the TSC may explicitly request presentation of specific material, decisions this shall be communicated clearly beforehand by the OR. A project is required to submit a controlling report to each TSC in accordance with the submission deadlines. Controlling report template to be linked here. An ASAM Office Responsible shall reference these rules prior to the initiation of project votes in any meeting. Every project member may request that a topic be voted on. Additionally, the meeting initiator may set up a quick poll first to identify topics that require a formal voting. In a voting, each project member has one vote, votes cannot be transferred to other project members. It is strongly recommended that if a project member has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a project member casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally) and their votes conflict, their vote is counted as abstention. Choices can be voting-specific (for example if the project is deciding between two or more options). Abstention is a valid vote. For approval votes, the choices are yes, no, abstention. A voting is only valid if: At least 50% of project members cast their vote Voting is decided by simple majority (abstentions do not count). The exception to the above rule is a project release voting prior to submission to the ASAM TSC. For such a voting a two-thirds majority of all project members is needed. Any no-votes should be submitted with a justification by the project group to the next TSC meeting. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. Failing to submit a vote does not count towards the number of voting project members. Both onsite and remote users shall be enabled to vote. Should a project member not submit their vote during the project group meeting, this member shall be considered absent without excuse for the meeting. The overall validity of the vote may be affected, see voting is only valid if. Also refer to inactive project members. Exceptions to the voting rules shall be escalated to the TSC. Project group voting takes place during meetings. Results shall be made available in the corresponding meeting minutes. By default, a voting is announced in the agenda (before a meeting takes place).

This concept refers to using the same tools and methods for documentation (or standardization) as for writing (software) code. The main benefit of this concept is the separation of content and text in documents from its layout rules and publishing. The general concept is to use established tools and processes from software development and apply them in the creation of documents. At ASAM, the main aspects of this concept are: Writing documents in plain text markup Using repositories with version control systems Collaborating on projects through online repository platforms Automation of repetitive steps using automation pipelines The first aspect of this concept is the usage of plain text documents with a semantic markup language in creating standards and other documents, particularly the free AsciiDoc format. Its main benefit is the separation of content from style and layout rules, making it possible to specify general layout settings in a separate set of files and instructions for consistency over multiple projects. Another benefit is that AsciiDoc files can be opened and edited with any type of text editor, making it a platform-agnostic format. Different people can write content independent of the operating system on their work devices and without requiring specific software licenses. Additionally, plain text files work especially well with respositories and version control systems. They provide tools for viewing changes, making collaboration particularly easy. Finally, the content is decoupled from the target output, making it simple to generate different types of documentation from the same source files if needed. AsciiDoc source file Rendered output [#top-a3744269-489e-44bb-8c94-ca8759d3df7c] = Foreword ASAM e.V. (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) is a non-profit organization that promotes standardization of tool chains in automotive development and testing. Our members are international car manufacturers, suppliers, tool vendors, engineering service providers, and research institutes. ASAM standards are developed by experts from our member companies and are based on real use cases. ASAM is the legal owner of these standards and is responsible for their distribution and marketing. ASAM standards span a wide range of use cases in automotive development, test, and validation. They define file formats, data models, protocols, and interfaces. The standards enable easy exchange of data and tools within and across tool chains. They are applied worldwide. Figure 1. The same Foreword section rendered by Asciidoctor and Antora in HTML (rich output) Using tool-supported document versioning is another main aspect in the Doc-as-Code approach. ASAM projects frequently use the software Git for this purpose. It allows for working on different parts, features, or versions of a project separately. With Git, all of these can be merged again later. Content is stored in repositories. Each repository consists of one or more branches. At ASAM, there is one main branch (also called trunk) and possibly one or more feature branches. When changes need to be made, they are added through branches created from the trunk. Each child branch targets a single aspect of development. Once the development in a child branch is complete, its changes are merged back into the trunk. This is done through a Merge Request (MR) in GitLab, or a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub. Figure 2. Repository workflow and branching example. If you want to learn more about Git itself, ASAM recommends online introductions and tutorials such as Git-Guide, R. Dudler. Using online collaboration platforms with repository support has multiple benefits: They typically provide online editors for content, so users can choose to participate in projects without having to install software (besides any standard web browser) Merge Requests (Pull Requests) can be reviewed and commented on with a side-by-side preview in the browser (diff view) They act as central repository location for the project(s) that can be accessed from anywhere (provided the user has sufficient rights), so all involved people always have access to the latest submitted changes They enable central automation steps through CI/CD pipelines, for example automated writing rules checks on a document after it was updated They provide integrated issue boards for keeping track of tasks, found problems, discussion topics, etc. The figure below shows an example issue from a project where a topic discussion takes place. Figure 3. Example for a topic discussion through the GitLab issue board in a project ASAM currently supports projects on both its internal GitLab instance as well as on the public GitHub. Unless explicitly decided differently by the Office, new projects use GitLab. Pipelines in online repositories allow to automate repetitive steps, such as building a document and checking for structural and grammatical errors. ASAM projects typically automate the following steps: Publish AsciiDoc files using Asciidoctor or Antora Linting and testing documents for rules defined in the ASAM editorial guide and returning found errors Publishing results as pipeline artifacts for downloads or distribution Running project-specific scripts for additional features, such as converting UML diagrams to AsciiDoc files These pipeline instructions are stored in text files in each repository. In GitLab, they are stored as .gitlab-ci.yml. In GitHub, they are stored as \"workflows\" under .github/workflows. In both cases, the file is written in \"YAML\". If you want to learn more about pipelines, see the GitLab CI documentation or the GiHub blog.","title":"Documentation as Code","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"office-review-changes","name":"doc-as-code","url":"/asamprojectguide/office-review-changes/compendium/Development/doc-as-code.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Concept","hash":"_concept","id":2},{"text":"Plain text content files","hash":"sec-plain-text-markup","id":3},{"text":"Versioning and repositories","hash":"sec-versioning-repo","id":4},{"text":"Online collaboration","hash":"sec-online-collaboration","id":5},{"text":"Automation pipelines","hash":"sec-automation-pipeline","id":6}]},"77":{"id":77,"text":"This page describes requirements and guidelines for all project group and subgroup meetings. Clarification or co-development calls as well as similar informal types of meetings may choose to follow these guidelines. Any decisions made in such informal meetings are not valid until reviewed and agreed on in at least a subgroup or project meeting. Every meeting has an initiator. This is the person who calls the meeting. For project group meetings, the initiator is the project lead by default. The initiator has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Ensure a minute taker is defined. Provide the agenda for the meeting. Set up the meeting and send out the invites During the meeting Moderate the meeting If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants After the meeting Ensure that minutes are shared with participants. The minute taker is designated by the meeting initiator. This may be the initiator themselves. The minute taker has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Create the meeting minutes document ahead of time Add the provided agenda to the meeting notes During the meeting Document the participants as well as missing meeting members Take notes during the meeting Document all assigned tasks with their assignees Add provided links and documents After the meeting Request missing documents and links from the responsible participants Update the notes with delivered updates (e.g. links to files) Finalize the notes once everything has been provided Inform the initiator in case of overdue tasks Meeting agenda A well-structured agenda helps keep meetings organized, efficient, and on track, ensuring that important issues are covered, and goals are achieved within the allocated time. The initiator of the meeting shall provide a meeting agenda at the latest 1 week in advance of a meeting. The target audience depends on the meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR. The list of project participants can be found in the project’s participant list. This list also contains information on the group or groups each participant is part of. All meetings for a project are set up by its OR All meetings are hosted using ASAM’s Microsoft Teams platform These are covered in guidelines for formal voting. An inactive project member is a project member who has been absent, without informing the meeting initiator beforehand, from two consecutive project group and/or subgroup meetings. Inactive project members make it difficult for a project to accurately gauge its available resources for project planning and may even hinder the decision-making process at project group meetings. As a first step, inactive project members are contacted by the OR in order to clarify the issue. If no response is received, original commitment is no longer possible or the project member fails to attend a further consecutive meeting, then the project member in question is submitted to the project group for a vote to be removed. Removed project members lose access to all project material and meetings. In the regular controlling presentations to the TSC, the project shall inform the TSC of changes to project members. Rejoining an ASAM project is subject to the process for joining a running project. An ASAM member may apply at any time to join a running project. This is subject to: A short presentation to the project by the member on their motivation for joining, their current activities and what they aim to bring to the project Formal vote by the project group on whether to accept the request to join Begin discussing document structure early on. This helps to structure discussions. This structure will continue to evolve over the course of the project. Identify key terminology early on and define it to ease communication within the project. Make use of the advantages of face to face meetings (discussion, fast resolution of items), prepare topics in advance to be addressed in such F2Fs. Ensure regular review and reevaluation of project and subgroup status w.r.t. project milestones If you have preexisting efforts that you want to contribute to the standard it is possible to transfer IP to ASAM to be used.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. Never work on the trunk directly — always work in separate branches! The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Tags are used to identify fixed states of the repository, including official releases and other versions where the project deems it necessary. Version-based tags use semantic versioning. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived (<2 weeks) and regularly merged back. These branches MAY be squashed and MUST be merged via fast-forward merge (enabled by default). Once an issue can be implemented, the issue’s assignee creates a branch with an associated Merge or Pull Request from the issue. Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches. Begin submitting work via commits to the branch. Involved project participants review and comment changes through the associated Pull/Merge Request. These comments work identically to those described in \"discuss issues\". Review implementation progress of issue with other project participants in Subgroup or project meetings. Discussions and their results are documented in the Pull/Merge Request Once the group agrees that the feature is complete, the issue state transitions to isState:Implemented. If the Merge/Pull Request is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Tips If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident.

Relationship between meeting types The TSC reviews the status of ongoing projects and approves new activities, budget and releases. Scope changes or unforeseen problems in a project are also subject to approval by the TSC. All information on upcoming TSC meetings, including date, location and submission deadlines for material is published on the ASAM website. Meeting minutes are also made available shortly after a meeting. Project leads shall be informed of any deadlines by their OR in advance. All content for these meetings shall be submitted in advance in accordance with the deadlines set on the website. The tasks and processes of the ASAM TSC are documented in the TSC Guidelines. A project group meeting is declared as such when all enrolled project members are invited to participate. The most common examples for these meetings are the kick-off workshop status meetings review meetings A project group meeting is used to hold project level votes, align across subgroups and evaluate the overall status with respect to the project plan. These meetings are recommended to be held in person (face to face). This must be clearly communicated in the meeting agenda and made available sufficiently in advance to allow for travel organization. ASAM requires project group meetings to take place at least quarterly. ASAM recommends project group meetings take place at least every two months. Formal voting is only possible in a project group meeting. See the guidelines for formal voting. Every subgroup may schedule their own meetings. Typically, these meetings happen more frequently than the larger project group meetings. Subgroups discuss progress, setbacks, and current topics within the scope of their assigned work packages. Each subgroup shall present results, decisions and substantial changes to the whole project group in regular intervals but not less than in quarterly project group meetings. Decision making in subgroups is consensus-based. Meeting participants engage in open discussions, actively listen to each other’s perspectives, and work together to find common ground and solutions that accommodate the interests and concerns of all involved. The goal is to achieve a decision that reflects the broad consensus of the group and ensures that everyone feels heard and valued.

Prior to submitting to the TSC, project consensus on the request being submitted is required. See the TSC Guidelines for guidance on submission. In some cases the TSC may explicitly request presentation of specific material, decisions this shall be communicated clearly beforehand by the OR. A project is required to submit a controlling report to each TSC in accordance with the submission deadlines. Controlling report template to be linked here. An ASAM Office Responsible shall reference these rules prior to the initiation of project votes in any meeting. Every project member may request that a topic be voted on. Additionally, the meeting initiator may set up a quick poll first to identify topics that require a formal voting. In a voting, each project member has one vote, votes cannot be transferred to other project members. It is strongly recommended that if a project member has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a project member casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally) and their votes conflict, their vote is counted as abstention. Choices can be voting-specific (for example if the project is deciding between two or more options). Abstention is a valid vote. For approval votes, the choices are yes, no, abstention. A voting is only valid if: At least 50% of project members cast their vote Voting is decided by simple majority (abstentions do not count). The exception to the above rule is a project release voting prior to submission to the ASAM TSC. For such a voting a two-thirds majority of all project members is needed. Any no-votes should be submitted with a justification by the project group to the next TSC meeting. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. Failing to submit a vote does not count towards the number of voting project members. Both onsite and remote users shall be enabled to vote. Should a project member not submit their vote during the project group meeting, this member shall be considered absent without excuse for the meeting. The overall validity of the vote may be affected, see voting is only valid if. Also refer to inactive project members. Exceptions to the voting rules shall be escalated to the TSC.

A project may be anything from a whitepaper, a study group to develop knowledge, a concept to begin defining concepts for a potential standard, or a standardization effort to develop new standards or improve on existing standards. Project group The full group of all formally enrolled project participants. A formal organizational structure comprising project participants assigned to collectively achieve the objectives and deliverables of a project. It serves as the primary unit for project management and coordination. Project member A company enrolled in a project via one or more project participants. A project member has one vote, irrespective of the number of it’s project participants. Project participant An individual, representing a project member, enrolled in a project with a defined commitment. Actively involved in a project’s activities, tasks, or processes, contributing to the project’s planning, execution, monitoring, and completion. Contributors may assume various roles and responsibilities, and their involvement can vary in scope and duration based on their contributions to the project. Subgroup A subgroup is a subset of the project group composed of voluntary project participants who collaborate on specific tasks, functions, or areas within the project. Subgroups are formed to enhance focus, efficiency, and specialization within the larger project group. Subgroups work collaboratively with other subgroups and the main project group to ensure that their contributions align with the overall project objectives. CCB A subgroup of experts from the project taking on this optional and additional role. The Change Control Board (CCB) is responsible for internal alignment of topics, release management and approval/review of pull requests: Issue and MR/PR review Classification of issues Assignment of issues to solution developer(s) Milestone monitoring and planning Ensure alignment of individual Subgroup topics Release management Commitment to the CCB is for the duration of a project. Average commitment entails 1-2 hour meetings every 2 weeks during active development and offline review of content. Technical Steering Comittee (TSC) The ASAM Technical Steering Committee is a group of elected members to which the ASAM Board of Directors has delegated various technical and strategic tasks. The Technical Steering Committee decides about and controls all technical projects at ASAM. The main task of the TSC is to ensure that the product portfolio of ASAM meets market needs and stays competitive. The TSC evaluates and votes on proposals for the development or enhancement of products, monitors the progress of ongoing projects, reviews and releases new or revised products. The TSC ensures that products do not overlap or contradict each other. See the TSC Guidelines for further detail on this ASAM body. Office Responsible (OR) The ASAM contact for a project. An Office Responsible (OR) is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project. Project Lead (PL) The Project Participant responsible for the project and leading the general project activities. Every project needs one elected Project Lead who takes responsibility for it. The Project Lead is elected at the beginning of the Development Phase. Any Project Participant can send in their candidacy during the Proposal Phase. Subgroup Lead (SGL) An active Project Participant leading the activities of a subgroup. Technical Writer (TW) See Integrator. Integrator A role prescribed by the ASAM contribution workflow. This role is specified by each project prior to starting development, in most cases this should be a project kickoff. The Integrator is responsible for integrating the developed solution into the standard. Their task is to make sure the writing style is kept consistent and the ASAM editorial rules are met. The Integrator may be a service provider tasked with documentation efforts in the project. Alternatively, the Integrator may be the Office Responsible or a project participant. The integrator shall be clearly named in a project repository readme. Workflow manager A role prescribed by the ASAM contribution workflow. Orchestrates and manages the entire workflow, the process through which contributions are reviewed, approved, merged, and integrated into a project. Typically, the Workflow Manager is experienced with using remote repositories. This role is assigned to a specific project participant or subgroup by a project prior to starting development, in most cases this should be a project kickoff. This may be any one of: Project Lead Office Responsible Subgroup Lead Change Control Board (CCB) Project participant Solution responsible A role prescribed by the ASAM contribution workflow. An individual to whom a specific issue has been assigned that is responsible for developing or ensuring the development and finalisation of a solution addressing it (InProgress state).

Different projects entail different expectations towards the type of deliverables, although the quality expectations remain. ASAM project types are: Concept projects prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or the development of new ASAM standards Standard development projects develop a new version or versions for a standard in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. Study projects provide members an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards or technology sectors in a collaborative way. Implementation project, the output is software, tooling or reference implementations to support the use and adoption of one or more standards. Unless indicated otherwise, all projects undergo all project phases and are subject to the contribution workflow for projects. Deliverables of all projects are subject to the rules defined in the ASAM Editorial Guide unless explicitly declared otherwise. Concept projects prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards. The goals of concept projects are: to propose specific content for ASAM standards to provide justification or proof for the usefulness, practicability and feasibility of the proposals In order to reach the goals and to enable the project group to develop specific content proposals, concept projects may include some of the following methods: feasibility study requirements evaluation technology survey development of a prototype carrying out performance benchmarks The minimum deliverable of a concept project must be a concept paper. The paper shall include the findings of the project group and proposals for ASAM standards. Proposals for ASAM standards shall be as specific as possible. Ideally, the concept project documents their proposals in a copy-paste ready format, as it could be taken over into the respective ASAM standard. Upon request, ASAM provides funding for concept projects up to 75% of the total required project budget. Link to the concept paper template to be added. The result of a standard development project is a new or revised standard. ASAM provides funding for standard development projects up to 25% of the total required project budget. Each standard may have only one development project at a time. For more detail on versioning, see standard versioning. ASAM distinguishes between two types of standard development project. Link to the standard templates to be added. Development of new, major or minor versions of standards. The new version of a standard(s) is defined by the project during its development and approved by the TSC. Maintenance projects resolve technical issues with the currently released version of the standard. They meet one or more of the following criteria: Correction of errors Removal of ambiguities Addition of clarifications to existing descriptions Editorial improvements Any kind of changes to examples, including the addition of examples It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. Revisions cannot include new features. The only exception is, that a new feature has been forgotten in an earlier release of the standard and is absolutely required for a functional and meaningful standard. A new revision version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. The only exception is, that the correction of an error or the removal of an ambiguity cannot be reasonably solved in any other way than breaking the backward compatibility. An exception requires approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Revision development projects may be converted to a minor or major version development project during the course of the project term, if backward-compatibility issues turn out to be too severe or new features need to be added. The TSC has to approve this change of project type. Only those ASAM members, who were actively involved in development of the preceding major or minor version, can participate in the revision development project. Revision projects are limited to a life cycle of up to 18 months. Unlike other project types, the paid service provider for a revision project can be contracted without a public request for quotation. The service provider is confirmed by the TSC and is appointed before the project starts. The project leader and the service provider must be employees from different companies. See here for the template for a new standard document. Study projects provide members an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards in a collaborative way. Study projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards among the participants, to promote their application in member companies and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards. This project type is specifically intended for members in regions, where ASAM standards are not well known. The content of study projects can be, but is not limited to: collaborative self-study of an ASAM standard receive training on an ASAM standard carry out a suitability analysis of an ASAM standard against defined usecases carry out a pilot project to become familiar with the practical application of ASAM-related tools carry out an interoperability analysis of ASAM-related tools Study projects have no expected deliverables other than a final report. The members of study projects shall submit change requests if they find issues or gaps in ASAM standards. The requirements towards contribution and editorial rules do not apply for study projects. The application process for study project differs and is as follows: Member submits a Study Project Proposal to the ASAM Office for project approval. NOTE: Workgroup Information Sheet ASAM Office checks the information and approves or rejects the project. ASAM Office informs the TSC about the project. ASAM Office publishes an announcement of the project. The study project starts and is being carried out as described in the study project information sheet. The ASAM Office monitors the project activities. Some further rules apply for study projects: Participation in study projects is open for all ASAM members, e.g. also to members in a non \"active\" membership class. Participation in a study project can be restricted to members of a specific region, e.g. Japan only. The working language can be different than English. The project members elect a project leader. Meetings are documented via meeting minutes in English language. The minutes may be translated into the working language of the study group. The project members use the ASAM IT infrastructure. Upon request, ASAM provides funding for study projects up to the limit for small budget projects. Should a greater budget be required, a study project is subject to the full project process. See the TSC Guidelines for further detail on project budgets. An implementation project has the purpose to create a supplementary product that supports the application of an ASAM standard in the industry. An ASAM product shall cover one of the following usecases: supports the development of standard-based, commercial products (e.g. development tool kit) ensures standard-based interoperability of commercial products (e.g. source code) reduce the development costs of commercial products (e.g. source code) is used for testing the standard compliance of commercial products (e.g. checker tool, test suite, source code) Another auxiliary purpose of an implementation project can be to support the standard development by providing feedback from the implementers to the standard developers to improve the quality and maturity of the standard while it is still in development. For liability reasons, ASAM shall develop and distribute source code only as a result of an implementation project. Members may use the source code to create tools or other executables from the source code. As an example, implementation projects may include the development of source code for one of the following products. This list is not exhaustive and should only serve as a guideline of what might be a meaningful, supplementary product to an ASAM standard. Checker tool for syntax checks of non-schema-based file formats Checker tool for plausibility checks of schema-based file formats Checker tool for API checks Add-on or plug-in for de-facto standard IDEs (e.g. MATLAB, Simulink, Eclipse etc.) Importers or parsers Exporters or generators Reference implementations of tools or tool components Behavioral software components Additions to popular open-source projects (e.g. Eclipse, openMDM, Artop, etc.) API stubs and skeletons The deliverable(s) of an implementation project must have product-quality. Consequently, ASAM products are professionally developed in accordance to customary quality guidelines of the automotive or IT industries, whichever is applicable. This requires that the software is developed by a contractor, while the ASAM project group controls and reviews the contractor’s implementation. Upon request, ASAM provides funding up to 100% of the project’s required budget. Excluded are expenses for meeting participation and travel.","title":"Project types","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"office-review-changes","name":"02_project_types","url":"/asamprojectguide/office-review-changes/compendium/Projects/02_project_types.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Concept project","hash":"_concept_project","id":2},{"text":"Standard development","hash":"_standard_development","id":3},{"text":"Future version development (FVD)","hash":"_future_version_development_fvd","id":4},{"text":"Maintenance","hash":"_maintenance","id":5},{"text":"Study","hash":"_study","id":6},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"_implementation","id":7}]},"84":{"id":84,"text":"Besides different types of projects, there are five main project phases that ASAM defines.

The ASAM project phases Proposal Development Review Release Purpose To define the technical scope of a project at ASAM. Required for Every project type. Timeline The typical Proposal Phase timeline consists of All projects at ASAM are required to begin with the proposal phase. The focus of this period is to refine the technical content of a potential project with interested parties. A project shall hold at least one proposal workshop. It is used to present more insight into the scope and gather further feedback and parties. The output of the proposal phase is a set of proposal documents, detailing the project’s targets, participants, the budget, timeline, and other project-related information, such as the type of the project. The proposal documents are the basis for the TSC to decide whether to approve a project. Should a project be approved, it proceeds on to the Development phase. Download the project proposal templates [here]. Purpose To develop the project’s deliverables. Required for Every project type. Timeline The length of the Development Phase varies from project to project. However, most projects' proposed development duration lies between 12 and 24 months. This is the main phase of each project. If you want to learn more about how to get ready for your project, check out the Guided tour. During this phase, the project-type specific deliverables are developed by the project participants. In the beginning, the project group organizes a kickoff workshop to specify their modus operandi and set up all technical aspects of the project. In particular, the Project Lead who is the main responsible for the project is elected. Depending on the size of the project, other roles such as subgroup leads are also elected. Additionally, the project group may also contract one or more Service Providers as outside help if the required budget was included in the Proposal document. This is followed by one or more development intervals, specifying, writing, and reviewing content internally until the document or documents are ready for the Review Phase. During development, the project group has regular project group meetings. ASAM recommends a 2 month interval for these larger meetings. For more information on the types of meetings during a project’s development, see Project meetings in the Guided tour. Purpose To review the developed deliverables. Required for All projects Timeline The typical Review Phase timeline looks like this: Figure 2. The Review phase timeline Before a standard is officially released, all deliverables have to be reviewed. These shall be complete. The review phase shall always consist of the following review periods. A project member review A native speaker review An ASAM office review All projects, except for maintenance projects are also required to plan one of: A public review An ASAM member review After each review period, all feedback shall be reviewed and the group shall either accept or reject it. Accepted feedback shall be implemented. The project group has full authority on how and to which extent to address the reviewers' feedback. Reviewers may not submit new use-cases, features, or requirements as part of their review feedback. If this is the case, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the relevant issue system with state NEW. Once the deliverables have been successfully reviewed and no issues remain open, the project continues to the Release Phase. If any review points lead to a need of significant development effort, the project transitions to the development phase or decides to move the issue or feature out of scope and it is documented in the issue system. Purpose To release the developed deliverables. Required for Every project type. Timeline The typical Release Phase timeline looks like this: Figure 3. The Release phase timeline The project group prepares a release candidate and agrees via [formal voting] to submit the candidate to the TSC for release decision. The Project Lead submits the following to ASAM: executive summary of the standard complete deliverables for the standard all source code required to generate the deliverables for the standard including written instructions how to generate them a release presentation Download the template for a release presentation here. Sources are those digital work products, which can be modified or edited with standard tools such as text editors, image processors or modeling tools, and which are the input used to produce the final deliverables.

The only exception is new features introduced by the newer version of the standard. A feature in terms of ASAM standards is a significant characteristic functionality, data object or process, which is perceived by users of the standard as one specification entity. Special consideration is made for new standards. A first release of an ASAM standard is versioned as \"1.0.0\". A new standard meets the following criteria: There exists no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio. A predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio was deprecated and a new standard in the same technology area shall be developed from scratch. The new standard is an extension, substitution or parallel development of a standard from another standardization organization. If a new standard replaces a deprecated standard, then the new standard shall not have the same name as the deprecated standard. Major version developments of ASAM standards introduce significant changes to the standard. Major version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Addition of a new, major feature. Significant changes to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike. A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor versions. Minor version developments of ASAM standards introduce changes to existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard. Minor version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Addition of new features, which are considered as small relative to existing features. Insignificant changes or additions to existing features. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. A new minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard. Revision version developments of ASAM standards resolve technical issues with the currently released version of the standard. Revision version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria: Correction of errors. Removal of ambiguities. Addition of clarifications to existing descriptions. Editorial improvements. Any kind of changes to examples, including the addition of examples. It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. Maintenance versions cannot include new features. The only exception is, that a new feature has been forgotten in an earlier release of the standard and is absolutely required for a functional and meaningful standard. A new maintenance version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. The only exception is, that the correction of an error or the removal of an ambiguity cannot be reasonably solved in any other way than breaking the backward compatibility. An exception requires approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard.","title":"Versioning of standards","component":"asamprojectguide","version":"office-review-changes","name":"01_standard_versioning","url":"/asamprojectguide/office-review-changes/compendium/Standards/01_standard_versioning.html","titles":[{"text":"New standard","hash":"_new_standard","id":1},{"text":"Major version","hash":"_major_version","id":2},{"text":"Minor version","hash":"_minor_version","id":3},{"text":"Maintenance version","hash":"_maintenance_version","id":4}]},"86":{"id":86,"text":"ASAM defines two types of standard, base standard and associated standard. Irrespective of the type, all standards may consist of several documents or parts. These parts are independent (e.g., technology references) and must each individually comply with the basic document structure for ASAM standards. See the ASAM Editorial Guide for further details on document types and structure. A base standard defines the syntax, abstract models, and functionality for general use. A base standard is defined in a technology-independent form. It can use a problem-/taskrelated notation, e.g., UML for an object model, or any suitable description for protocols. Typically, a base standard may be: A format description (data structure) A protocol definition An application programming interface A base standard has the following properties: Platform-independent Technology-independent Supplier-independent Does not contradict any other ASAM standard An associated standard always refers to a base standard. An associated standard is not an extension of the base standard, rather it is targeted at a specific use case.

A Specification describes the code of operation, the structure, and the usage of the standard. Most ASAM standards also include one or more of the following documents or parts. For more information on naming of documents/parts, see the ASAM Editorial Guide Figure 1. An example structure of an ASAM standard Model Reference Describes all model elements and functions in the data model User Guideline Additional non-normative content that supplements the normative specification. Often includes usage examples and guidance on application of standard-specific features. Technology Reference and Mapping Reference It is common practice in standardization to define technology-independent standards. Often these are defined as data models, particularly when intended for data formats or apis. These standards will generally include some technology-specific mappings for users looking to implement these standards in specific technologies. The advantage of this approach, is that future developments can add or remove such technology-specific mappings depending on the evolution in the industry. At ASAM these are called \"Technology References\" and are independent part of the base standard. A technology reference is not an implementation! See a python mapping for a function call from the XIL API below: def _getConfiguration(self): \"\"\"Creates an instance of the RecorderConfiguration class. @type @rtype IRecorderConfiguration \"\"\" raise NotImplementedError() One example, of many within ASAM, is ODS, in the past this provided a mapping of the data model for its API to CORBA. Now it is adding a mapping to HTTP/REST. This is not exclusive. Other examples: ASAM SOVD API specified technology-independently, deliverables include a mapping to OpenAPI (yaml). See for example the capability description in section 6 on page 32 in the SOVD specification and the corresponding OpenAPI mapping ASAM XIL API specified in a data model, two mappings included.

It is particularly useful for designing and visualizing software architecture but can also be used for other types of diagrams such as sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, state diagrams, object diagrams, and deployment diagrams. The key features of PlantUML include: Plain Text Descriptions: Diagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive language. This makes it easy to create and modify diagrams without needing complex graphical tools. Version Control Friendly: Since diagrams are described in text, they can be easily version-controlled alongside software code, providing a history of changes and facilitating collaboration. Wide Range of Diagram Types: PlantUML supports various types of UML diagrams, as well as other diagrams like Gantt charts and mind maps. Integration: It can be integrated into various software tools like wikis, forums, and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) for easier access and usage. Automation: PlantUML allows for automation in generating diagrams, which is particularly useful in large projects where diagrams need to be updated frequently. Export Formats: Diagrams can be exported to different formats such as PNG, SVG, and ASCII art. Open Source: PlantUML is open source, allowing users to modify or extend its capabilities according to their needs.

A trunk-based repository is a repository that has a single central branch (the \"trunk\"). This trunk contains the official and reviewed state of a project. Users are not allowed to commit and push changes to this specific branch directly. Instead, all changes on the repository’s content are made in child branches. These can either be branched off of the trunk or from another branch. Once ready, a branch is merged back into its parent branch (which may be the trunk or another feature branch). The benefit of this approach is that each repository’s trunk contains the latest official state or version. Mistakes and unfinished changes to parts of it only have an impact on the branch where they happen. Never work on the trunk directly — always work in separate branches! The central branch (\"trunk\") can only be merged to by the ASAM office, the Project Lead, or the project’s Change Control Board (CCB). Tags are used to identify fixed states of the repository, including official releases and other versions where the project deems it necessary. Version-based tags use semantic versioning. Changes MUST be added through branches created from the trunk or another branch. These branches SHOULD be short-lived (<2 weeks) and regularly merged back. These branches MAY be squashed and MUST be merged via fast-forward merge (enabled by default). Once an issue can be implemented, the issue’s assignee creates a branch with an associated Merge or Pull Request from the issue. Each branch must have a parent issue and each issue may have zero or one child branches. Begin submitting work via commits to the branch. Involved project participants review and comment changes through the associated Pull/Merge Request. These comments work identically to those described in \"discuss issues\". Review implementation progress of issue with other project participants in Subgroup or project meetings. Discussions and their results are documented in the Pull/Merge Request Once the group agrees that the feature is complete, the issue state transitions to isState:Implemented. If the Merge/Pull Request is set to \"Draft:\", remove the draft flag from the Merge/Pull Request name Tips If a branch cannot be short-lived, rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes. Create branches directly from the issue to ensure the branch is linked to the issue. This also provides the option to set up the related Merge/Pull Request right away. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) are already accessible through the parent issue. Adding \"DRAFT: \" in front of a Merge/Pull Request’s name marks it as not ready for merge and disables the \"Merge\" button. This way, the Merge/Pull Request (and its branch) cannot be concluded by accident.

A topic must be presented at the next project group meeting if any of the following apply: Changes to the underlying data model are involved It is requested by one or more subgroup participants It is requested by the project lead It is requested by a project steering committee (e.g. the CCB) A consensus-based decision is not feasible or possible If a project wishes to change its scope or timeline or requires a change to budget it should submit to the TSC for a decision. Prior to submitting to the TSC, project consensus on the request being submitted is required. See the TSC Guidelines for guidance on submission. In some cases the TSC may explicitly request presentation of specific material, decisions this shall be communicated clearly beforehand by the OR. A project is required to submit a controlling report to each TSC in accordance with the submission deadlines. Controlling report template to be linked here. An ASAM Office Responsible shall reference these rules prior to the initiation of project votes in any meeting. Every project member may request that a topic be voted on. Additionally, the meeting initiator may set up a quick poll first to identify topics that require a formal voting. In a voting, each project member has one vote, votes cannot be transferred to other project members. It is strongly recommended that if a project member has multiple participants in a project, they decide on their vote and who will cast it ahead of time. If a project member casts multiple votes (accidentally or intentionally) and their votes conflict, their vote is counted as abstention. Choices can be voting-specific (for example if the project is deciding between two or more options). Abstention is a valid vote. For approval votes, the choices are yes, no, abstention. A voting is only valid if: At least 50% of project members cast their vote Voting is decided by simple majority (abstentions do not count). The exception to the above rule is a project release voting prior to submission to the ASAM TSC. For such a voting a two-thirds majority of all project members is needed. Any no-votes should be submitted with a justification by the project group to the next TSC meeting. An abstention vote counts as a cast vote. Failing to submit a vote does not count towards the number of voting project members. Both onsite and remote users shall be enabled to vote. Should a project member not submit their vote during the project group meeting, this member shall be considered absent without excuse for the meeting. The overall validity of the vote may be affected, see voting is only valid if. Also refer to inactive project members. Exceptions to the voting rules shall be escalated to the TSC. Project group voting takes place during meetings. Results shall be made available in the corresponding meeting minutes. By default, a voting is announced in the agenda (before a meeting takes place). However, if spontaneous topics arise, ad hoc voting may be performed. An adhoc voting is only valid if the following is true: At least 50% of project members cast their vote All impacted project members are present (this may include issue responsibles or solution developers) The voting result shall represent a majority opinion such that votes by absent participants could not influence the end result Some topics require a formal voting: Election of Project Lead Changes of project scope Budget request Evaluation of service providers Significant changes to deliverables Escalation of topics to TSC Release decision Note that certain subgroup decisions require an escalation to a project voting.

Any decisions made in such informal meetings are not valid until reviewed and agreed on in at least a subgroup or project meeting. Every meeting has an initiator. This is the person who calls the meeting. For project group meetings, the initiator is the project lead by default. The initiator has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Ensure a minute taker is defined. Provide the agenda for the meeting. Set up the meeting and send out the invites During the meeting Moderate the meeting If necessary, assign tasks with due dates to participants After the meeting Ensure that minutes are shared with participants. The minute taker is designated by the meeting initiator. This may be the initiator themselves. The minute taker has the following responsibilities: Before the meeting Create the meeting minutes document ahead of time Add the provided agenda to the meeting notes During the meeting Document the participants as well as missing meeting members Take notes during the meeting Document all assigned tasks with their assignees Add provided links and documents After the meeting Request missing documents and links from the responsible participants Update the notes with delivered updates (e.g. links to files) Finalize the notes once everything has been provided Inform the initiator in case of overdue tasks Meeting agenda A well-structured agenda helps keep meetings organized, efficient, and on track, ensuring that important issues are covered, and goals are achieved within the allocated time. The initiator of the meeting shall provide a meeting agenda at the latest 1 week in advance of a meeting. The target audience depends on the meeting type. While a project is still in the early phase, people will likely be moving from group to group For meetings within a group of a project, send the invite to those emails currently registered for the group For full project meetings, send the invite to the project’s mailing list For all meeting types, add the following as CC (if not invited directly): The Project Lead and the OR. The list of project participants can be found in the project’s participant list. This list also contains information on the group or groups each participant is part of. All meetings for a project are set up by its OR All meetings are hosted using ASAM’s Microsoft Teams platform These are covered in guidelines for formal voting. An inactive project member is a project member who has been absent, without informing the meeting initiator beforehand, from two consecutive project group and/or subgroup meetings. Inactive project members make it difficult for a project to accurately gauge its available resources for project planning and may even hinder the decision-making process at project group meetings. As a first step, inactive project members are contacted by the OR in order to clarify the issue. If no response is received, original commitment is no longer possible or the project member fails to attend a further consecutive meeting, then the project member in question is submitted to the project group for a vote to be removed. Removed project members lose access to all project material and meetings. In the regular controlling presentations to the TSC, the project shall inform the TSC of changes to project members. Rejoining an ASAM project is subject to the process for joining a running project. An ASAM member may apply at any time to join a running project. This is subject to: A short presentation to the project by the member on their motivation for joining, their current activities and what they aim to bring to the project Formal vote by the project group on whether to accept the request to join Begin discussing document structure early on. This helps to structure discussions. This structure will continue to evolve over the course of the project. Identify key terminology early on and define it to ease communication within the project. Make use of the advantages of face to face meetings (discussion, fast resolution of items), prepare topics in advance to be addressed in such F2Fs. Ensure regular review and reevaluation of project and subgroup status w.r.t. project milestones If you have preexisting efforts that you want to contribute to the standard it is possible to transfer IP to ASAM to be used.

Relationship between meeting types The TSC reviews the status of ongoing projects and approves new activities, budget and releases. Scope changes or unforeseen problems in a project are also subject to approval by the TSC. All information on upcoming TSC meetings, including date, location and submission deadlines for material is published on the ASAM website. Meeting minutes are also made available shortly after a meeting. Project leads shall be informed of any deadlines by their OR in advance. All content for these meetings shall be submitted in advance in accordance with the deadlines set on the website. The tasks and processes of the ASAM TSC are documented in the TSC Guidelines. A project group meeting is declared as such when all enrolled project members are invited to participate. The most common examples for these meetings are the kick-off workshop status meetings review meetings A project group meeting is used to hold project level votes, align across subgroups and evaluate the overall status with respect to the project plan. These meetings are recommended to be held in person (face to face). This must be clearly communicated in the meeting agenda and made available sufficiently in advance to allow for travel organization. ASAM requires project group meetings to take place at least quarterly. ASAM recommends project group meetings take place at least every two months. Formal voting is only possible in a project group meeting. See the guidelines for formal voting. Every subgroup may schedule their own meetings. Typically, these meetings happen more frequently than the larger project group meetings. Subgroups discuss progress, setbacks, and current topics within the scope of their assigned work packages. Each subgroup shall present results, decisions and substantial changes to the whole project group in regular intervals but not less than in quarterly project group meetings. Decision making in subgroups is consensus-based. Meeting participants engage in open discussions, actively listen to each other’s perspectives, and work together to find common ground and solutions that accommodate the interests and concerns of all involved. The goal is to achieve a decision that reflects the broad consensus of the group and ensures that everyone feels heard and valued.

When feature is complete and tests pass, stage the changes. git add --all When you’ve staged the changes, commit them. git status git commit --verbose Write a good commit message. Example format: Present-tense summary under 50 characters More information about commit (under 72 characters). More information about commit (under 72 characters). http://project.management-system.com/ticket/123 If you’ve created more than one commit, use git rebase interactively to squash them into cohesive commits with good messages: git rebase -i origin/main Share your branch. git push origin Submit a GitHub pull request. Ask for a code review in the project’s chat room. A team member other than the author reviews the pull request. They follow Code Review guidelines to avoid miscommunication. They make comments and ask questions directly on lines of code in the GitHub web interface or in the project’s chat room. For changes which they can make themselves, they check out the branch. git checkout ./bin/setup git diff staging/main..HEAD They make small changes right in the branch, test the feature on their machine, run tests, commit, and push. When satisfied, they comment on the pull request Ready to merge. Rebase interactively. Squash commits like \"Fix whitespace\" into one or a small number of valuable commit(s). Edit commit messages to reveal intent. Run tests. git fetch origin git rebase -i origin/main Force push your branch. This allows GitHub to automatically close your pull request and mark it as merged when your commit(s) are pushed to main. It also makes it possible to find the pull request that brought in your changes. git push --force-with-lease origin View a list of new commits. View changed files.

Commit staged files to your local repo (git commit). Push to a remote repository (git push). https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial A Merge or Pull Requests (MRs) are the way you merge content changes from a development or feature branch back into the trunk or another branch. They provide the project team the opportunity to review changes before they are applied and made public/official. History of commits in a MR must be clean prior to merge ASAM repositories allow fast-forward merges only (--ff-only) and squash commits by default. This means commits do not have to be merged manually and all commits are squashed automatically. For squash commits with one commit, the commit message is taken directly (squash does not take place). For actual squashes the commit messages are taken from: The first multi-line commit message in the merge. The merge request’s title if no multi-line commit message is found. Squash commits is enabled by default but can be turned off. This is to make sure that in case multiple unrelated changes occurred in one branch, they can still be all added to the history. Merge/Pull Requests are reviewed by the project team in sequential steps. A merge conflict occurs when multiple different changes (usually made by different users) are to be merged and some or all of the changes contradict each other. For example, if user A deletes a section in their copy and user B adds a new paragraph to it instead, the merging tool does not know whether to keep the section and add the changes made by user B or to delete it like user A did. One way of avoiding merge conflicts is to keep the TTL (time to live) of branches short. ASAM recommends a TTL of ⇐ 2 weeks. If the branch lives longer than expected, merge the parent branch (the trunk or original feature branch) into your branch once in a while. Alternatively, you can also rebase your branch to the parent branch again. This way you can solve the conflicts in your branch. For more information on the differences between merging and rebasing, see Merging vs. Rebasing. Once you create a merge request, your remote repository will tell you if there are merge conflicts. It leads you through the conflicting parts and lets you choose if your new or the old content is to be merged. Another option is to merge locally. You can use Git or Visual Studio Code for this. These tools also provide options to view conflicting changes and help you resolve them. After you have removed the conflicts, you can create a new commit to your branch that includes the fixes to resolve the conflict in the Merge/Pull Request.

However, not all functions that ASAM requires for an efficient and partially automated content structuring are present by default. For this reason, an Antora extension and an Asciidoctor extension were created. This page collects all the features of this extension, such as the custom macros, and explains what they do and how to use them. Each macro also has a detailed instructions page with more details. For more information on how to write an Antora extension, see the official extension guide and check out the relevant package repositories, particularly their devdocs folders. The source repository of the ASAM extensions is https://code.asam.net/common/asam-antora-extensions. All following examples assume the extension is located under \"./antora_extensions\", where \".\" is the location of the \"site.yml\" file (the Antora playbook). Most extensions are not fully supported in partials, particularly those depending on Asciidoctor features like \"include\"! The following table describes general configuration on using the extension: Attribute Description Default Example id Defines an id by which the extension can be specifically called from the CLI. none id: asam-extension enabled De-/activates this extension by default. If deactivated, the extension must be explicitely called from the CLI. Only relevant in combination with id. true enabled: false require Describes the location of the extension. none require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js' Example 1. General configuration for ASAM Antora extensions in site.yml - id: asam-extensions require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js' The following sections describe features directly applied through the pipeline. These are features that typically are relevant to the whole site. They enact general rules or features, or they collect information about all content. Orphan pages Keyword-overview page Page numbering Sequential figure and table numbers ISO-2145 style section numbers Convert local to global page references The ASAM Antora extension finds all pages not listed in any nav.adoc and puts a warning in the console output. If configured, these pages can also automatically be listed under a separated navigation entry (e.g. \"orphans\") at the end of the Antora document. For more details, see Pipeline: Orphan pages. The ASAM Antora extension generates an overview page that lists all keywords used in the Antora pages. The location and the (virtual) filename can be configured in the site.yml (Antora playbook). For more details, see Pipeline: Keyword page. To see the result of the applied pipeline feature, see By default, Antora does not support sequential page numbering. However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters. In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages. Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages. To fulfill this requirement, the \"Page numbering\" extension features were implemented. These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two (\"== \") sections on each page). Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential figure and table numbers. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential numbering. Since Asciidoctor counts all images and tables only within each page, their caption numbers start at 1 on every new Antora page by default. In case of standards, these numbers must be sequential (and unique) within each standard, not each page. Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential section numbers and page titles. For more details, see Pipeline: Sequential figure and table numbers. By default, section numbers in Asciidoctor have a trailing dot (\".\"). To be in line with ISO 2145, sections in standards have to be numbered without this trailing dot. The Antora extension, in combination with the 'sectnums_to_iso' extension for Asciidoctor, addresses this problem. For more details, see Pipeline: ISO-2145 style section and page numbering. Using Asciidoctor, it is typical to create one main file and include content from separate files. With this approach, each section or chapter can be managed separately while still compiling everything into a single final document. However, in Antora these sections or chapters stay separate in most cases since the idea is to be able to access them individually and independently. When working with documents originally intended for a single-file-inclusion strategy, local references that only work if other files are also included will not work for the individual pages in Antora. To circumvent this problem, the ASAM Antora extensions analyze all pages and try to find the source file of the reference. If the content is included in multiple pages, pages in the navigation structured are prioritized over unlisted pages. Note, however, that this approach has limitations and should only be used if switching to a more Antora-native approach is too difficult!

For more details, see Macro: role_related This ONLY works in nav.adoc files, not in regular pages or partials! The macro must also always be used as a comment (similarly to the Asciidoctor macro \"tag\"). If the module has a main page, add //autonav::[] without parameters in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. If the module has no main page, add //autonav::[none] in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file. The macro uses the following rules to determine the main page of a module: If there is a file named like the module on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"index.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else if there is a file named \"main.adoc\" on root level, use this as the main page. Else use the first page in the alphabetically sorted list. For more details, see Macro: autonav The source code can be found in the ASAM GitLab repository.

With this approach, each section or chapter can be managed separately while still compiling everything into a single final document. However, in Antora these sections or chapters stay separate in most cases since the idea is to be able to access them individually and independently. When working with documents originally intended for a single-file-inclusion strategy, local references that only work if other files are also included will not work for the individual pages in Antora. To circumvent this problem, the ASAM Antora extensions analyze all pages and try to find the source file of the reference. If the content is included in multiple pages, pages in the navigation structured are prioritized over unlisted pages. Note, however, that this approach has limitations and should only be used if switching to a more Antora-native approach is too difficult! Targets must have explicit anchors, not only section names Activate the extension in the site.yml. Add unique (i.e. unique over all pages in the project!) anchors to all pages, sections, or other positions.

However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters. In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages. Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages. To fulfill this requirement, the \"Page numbering\" extension features were implemented. These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two (\"== \") sections on each page). Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for sequential figure and table numbers.

To use this feature, add numbered_titles: true to the Antora extension configuration. If you want to activate section numbers by default, set the attribute in the site.yml or your component descriptor. If you want to be able to unset it manually per page, do a soft set. The following settings can be made per page. Note that globally set attributes (in site.yml or component descriptor) may overwrite these. For more information on using global and local attributes in Antora, see the official Antora attribute precedence rules. :sectnums: Activate section numbers from this point onward on this page. :sectnums!: Deactivate section numbers from this point onward on this page. :sectnumoffset: Define a manual offset value for the first level 2 section (\"== \") on this page. All following sections will inherit this as well. :titleoffset: Define a manual offset value for the title of the page. In addition to that, some general actions can be added as attributes in the navigation files. :start-level: Defines the level in the bullet point list from which on the sequential numbers are added. By default, this is set to 1, meaning that every item starting with \"*\" or higher will be included. If set to a higher number, page title numbers will only be added from that level onward. For example, if it is set to 3, all bullet points \"\\*\" and \"*\\*\" will be excluded and counting starts with the first element of \"*\\*\\*\". :reset-level-offset: Resets the counter back to the start value. :sectnums!: Deactivate section numbers for the next bullet point.

[appendix] Sets section and title numbers to start with capital letters.

To account for that and make tracking changes easier, this versioning concept is applied. The main idea of this concept is to have all officially released versions on main with a tag. Only tagged versions on this branch are displayed - with the exception of this Editing Guide. The current development happens on a branch named \"dev\". This branch is regularly merged back into main. The dev branch is never tagged. If a project, upon request, is granted to create a specific Project Guide variant, the variant’s latest commit is hosted. Project-specific guide variants are separated from the standard Project Guide into a collective Antora component. Each project is displayed as an Antora version. All released versions exist on the branch 'main'. Each new release must be tagged with v.., where , , and are numbers. Version numbers follow the Semantic Versioning rules. Development happens on the branch 'dev'. This branch must be marked as \"prerelease\" during development. No tags may be created on the 'dev' branch. Make sure to remove the prerelease attribute in the antora.yml before merging the dev changes back to main. Alternatively, do not merge the antora.yml. In case project-specific guides are required, a project may request a specific branch for content on the Project Guide. If the request is accepted, the project’s branch name will be 'open-x', where 'x' is the name of the project. Example: project 'OpenNEWSTANDARD' → branch name: 'open-newstandard'. No tags may be created on any project-specific branch. If important changes happen on the main branch that should impact the project as well, these changes shall be cherry-picked. Likewise, if a project concludes, its content is reviewed and approved updates from it shall be cherry-picked onto the 'dev' branch (and later be merged onto the 'main' branch). Antora can take content from different repositories, branches, and/or tags, and combine them in one single generate. In case of the ASAM Project Guide, the generator takes a single content repository and uses its two main folders to generate its content. However, the generator selects only a single branch+version combination from the 'guide' folder. In contrast to that, it takes multiple branches and tags from the 'content' folder. The figure above illustrates the applied mapping: The latest tagged version (in the example: v1.2.1) on the main branch gets the reference name 'latest' automatically All other tagged versions on main are displayed with their tag name The latest commit on main is also used for the \"Editing the ASAM Project Guide\" component The latest commit on the dev branch is used as pre-release version named \"dev\" The latest commit on any open-x branch is used for the corresponding \"version\" of the Specific Project Guide component All content on the branches 'main' and 'dev' use the component asamprojectguide All project-specific branches shall use the component specificguides The following rules are applied using git information: tag with 'v..' → version: x.y.z branch == 'open-*' → version: open* branch == 'dev' → version: dev The following must be specified by the branch maintainer: prerelease for 'dev'-branch (set to true) component name for open* branches (set to specificguides) Branches are not added automatically in Antora. Every branch that the Guide officially supports has to be added in the site.yml. Tags, however, are applied automatically as long as they follow the specified syntax: v.., where , , and are numbers. Example: v1.0.0 To generate the Project Guide, two repositories are used: a generator repository and a content repository. This is displayed in the figure below. Figure 1. Involved repositories in the Project Guide generation The content repository contains, as the name suggests, the content of the Project Guide. The repository mainly consists of two folders, 'content' and 'guide'. 'content' This folder contains all the ASAM Project Guide content. This is where everything intended for project participants and interested ASAM members is located. The generator takes this folder and, depending on the git reference (tag or branch), labels its version automatically. Note that, according to the [Mapping In Antora], the component for project-specific branches has to be specificguides, whereas the standard Guide content is asamprojectguide. 'guide' This folder contains all instructions and information on how to edit and maintain the Project Guide itself, including this page. Only one version of it may ever be available: the latest commit on the branch main or on dev (main by default)!","title":"Project Guide versioning
