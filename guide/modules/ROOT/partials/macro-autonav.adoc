//tag::description[]
include::partial$virtual_files.adoc[]

If added as a comment line to a nav.adoc file, replaces the files content with an automatically generated pages summary containing all pages and folders in the module.
The path structure is preserved and files and folders are sorted in alphabetical order (capital letters before small letters).

For each folder, the extension checks if a file with the same name on the level of the folder exists.
If not, a new virtual file with the name of the folder plus ".adoc" is generated and the xref:extensions/macro-pages.adoc["Pages" macro] added to its content.

//end::description[]

//tag::prerequisites[]
The module contains at least one page.
//end::prerequisites[]

//tag::parameters[]
[cols="1,1,4"]

| If set, the module main page is not searched.
Instead, all pages and folders are listed one level higher (i.e. all root level pages and folders get "\*", all content in the root-level folders gets "**" and so on).

IMPORTANT: This ONLY works in nav.adoc files, not in regular pages or partials!
The macro must also always be used as a comment (similarly to the Asciidoctor macro "tag").

* If the module has a main page, add `//autonav::[]` without parameters in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file.
* If the module has no main page, add `//autonav::[none]` in an empty line in the relevant nav.adoc file.


[NOTE]
====
The macro uses the following rules to determine the main page of a module:

* If there is a file named like the module on root level, use this as the main page.
* Else if there is a file named "index.adoc" on root level, use this as the main page.
* Else if there is a file named "main.adoc" on root level, use this as the main page.
* Else use the first page in the alphabetically sorted list.

Assuming the following folder structure in a module named "Module_A":

[source]
----
pages/
├── content_folder/
|   ├── additional_content/
|   |   └── special_content_FILE.adoc
|   ├── 01_proposal_setup.adoc
|   ├── 02_contributing.adoc
|   ├── 03_proposal_workshop_preparation.adoc
|   ├── 04_join_proposal_workshop.adoc
|   └── additional_content.adoc
├── Module_A_Description.adoc
├── a_file.adoc
├── index.adoc
└── second_file.adoc

, the example below shows the result for applying the macro in this module.
