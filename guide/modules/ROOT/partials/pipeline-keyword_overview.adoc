The ASAM Antora extension generates an overview page that lists all keywords used in the Antora pages.
The location and the (virtual) filename can be configured in the site.yml (Antora playbook).
//end::description[]

//tag::how[]
include::partial$virtual_files.adoc[]
To generate a keywords-overview page, the ASAM Antora extension must contain the 'keywords' attribute.
All other supported attributes for this feature are optional.
The only requirement is that they must all be added under `keywords:`.

NOTE: The keyword page will be added in all versions and components with the same name and at the same location!

//end::how[]

//tag::configuration[]
The following table lists the supported attributes as well as their default values:

|===
|Attribute |Description |Default |Example

|filename
|The name of the virtual file that is created to contain the list of used keywords.
Must end with ".adoc"!
This name can be used for `xref` or `include`.
|"0_used-keywords.adoc"
|`filename: "1_keywords.adoc`

|module
|The module where the file is supposed to be added.
Make sure that the module exists, as the created page will otherwise be an orphan.
|"ROOT"
|`module: "compendium"`

|path
|The path within the module where the file is to be located.
Separator is "/" and MUST ONLY be used between folders (no leading or trailing separator!).
|""
|`path: "keywords_path"`
|===

//end::configuration[]

//tag::example[]
The following example generates a virtual file named "1_keywords.adoc" in the module "compendium" and adds all identified keywords to it a sections.
Each keyword section contains a bullet point list with cross-references to the pages where the keyword was found.
