Using Asciidoctor, it is typical to create one main file and include content from separate files.
With this approach, each section or chapter can be managed separately while still compiling everything into a single final document.
However, in Antora these sections or chapters stay separate in most cases since the idea is to be able to access them individually and independently.

When working with documents originally intended for a single-file-inclusion strategy, local references that only work if other files are also included will not work for the individual pages in Antora.
To circumvent this problem, the ASAM Antora extensions analyze all pages and try to find the source file of the reference.
If the content is included in multiple pages, pages in the navigation structured are prioritized over unlisted pages.

Note, however, that this approach has limitations and should only be used if switching to a more Antora-native approach is too difficult!

//tag::how[]
Activate the extension in the site.yml.
Add unique (i.e. unique over all pages in the project!) anchors to all pages, sections, or other positions.

The extension will then automatically replace all local references (`\<<link, text>>`) that point to anchors on other pages with global references (`\xref:path/to/file[text]`).
If multiple files contain the same anchor (e.g. included partials), pages in the navigation tree are prioritized over xref:project-guide:extensions/pipeline-orphan_pages.adoc[orphan pages].

TIP: It is recommended to use xref:compendium:writing_guidelines/editorial_guide.adoc[ASAM-type anchors].
