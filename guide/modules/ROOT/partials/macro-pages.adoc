//tag::description[]
This macro creates cross-references under the section "Pages" at the macro location to all pages (with or without nested folders) in a given folder relative to the file with the macro.
If no folder is defined, the file's folder is used instead.

In addition to this replacement, an attribute `:pagemacro:` is automatically set so that the section numbering feature will exclude this section title automatically.
This helps other Antora extensions to identify this particular section header in order to act on it differently.
//end::description[]

//tag::prerequisites[]
At least one asciidoc file that is not this file must be in the target folder.

//tag::how[]
Add `page::[<arguments>]` in an empty line and replace `<arguments>` with a list of arguments, separated by "," (comma).
If you add no arguments, the macro will list all other pages in the same folder as this file.

//tag::example[]
Assuming the following folder structure:

[source]
----
this_page.adoc
other_page.adoc
my_folder/
├── ignored_subfolder/
|   └── ignored_file_in_subfolder.adoc
├── 01_proposal_setup.adoc
├── 02_contributing.adoc
├── 03_proposal_workshop_preparation.adoc
└── 04_join_proposal_workshop.adoc

, the example below shows the result for applying the macro with the path set to "my_folder".

.List all pages in the folder "my_folder" relative to the current file but not its subfolders
