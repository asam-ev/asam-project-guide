== Context
Roles are a way of structuring tasks within ASAM activities.
Assigning pages or topics to roles makes it easier for people of that role to find the pages most relevant to them and their tasks.
The use of role labels with automatic linking helps keep the effort of managing relationships between tasks and roles to a minimum.

If a new role needs to be created, several steps are needed to set it up correctly so that it utilizes this system most efficiently.

TIP: If you are looking for how to use an existing role on a page, see xref:adding_content/roles/use_roles.adoc[].

== Result
A new role main page has been defined, an interactive role label created and linked.

== Prerequisites
none

== How
. Add a new role main page to the module "role-specific" with the role name as filename
. Add a short role description of the new role to the partial "role_descriptions.adoc" in the "role-specific" module, using the following syntax:
+
[source,adoc]
----
:<role-name>-description: <description text>
----
+
, where `<role-name>` is the role name chosen as the filename and `<description text>` contains the short description of this role
. Add the new role to the table in the partial "roles.adoc" in the "role-specific" module, using the following syntax:
+
[source,adoc]
----
| {role-<role-name>}
| {<role-name>-description}
----
+
, where `<role-name>` is the role name chosen as the filename

. Add a new role label to the Project Guide's "site.yml" under '## Defined role attributes', using the following syntax:
+
[source, yaml]
----
role-<role-name>: 'xref:role-specific:<role-name>.adoc[<role style="color:black;font-weight: bold;width:500px;height:100px;border-radius: 25px;margin:10px 2px;padding:5px 15px;border:2px solid #000;background:<role-color>;" ><FULL-ROLE-NAME></role>]'
----
+
, where `<role-name>` is the role name chosen as the filename, `<role-color>` is the hex-code for the intended color of the label and `<FULL-ROLE-NAME>` is the full name of the role in capital letters.
