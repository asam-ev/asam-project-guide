## First Time Setup

You are new to ASAM projects? See the [setup guide](docs/general_guidelines/Setup-Guide.asciidoc) for a step-by-step on setting up your account and installing the tools we recommend for interacting with ASAM standards and repositories.

Additionally, see the guide to [Teams & Sharepoint](docs/general_guidelines/Microsoft-Teams-and-Sharepoint.adoc) for information on getting setup with Microsoft Teams.

Finally, [synchronize with the OpenX calendar](docs/general_guidelines/Shared-OpenX-Calendar.adoc), a shared calendar across all ASAM OpenX projects that lists all meetings taking place.
