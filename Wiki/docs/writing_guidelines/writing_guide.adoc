[#top-osc2-writing-guide]
= Writing guide
:numbered:
:toc: preamble

This guide is intended to help you writing content for ASAM projects.
It provides you a set of hints and rules that make it easier to contribute concise and homogeneous content and documents to the projects.

TIP: If you are using Visual Studio Code, see the xref:../tool-specific/Recommended-VSCode-Settings.adoc[recommended VSCode Settings].

== Language

=== Use American English (AE)

* Use "English (US)" (ISO: *en-US*) as a language setting in your text editor.
* Mnemonic: -or, -l, -yze, -er

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-ae]
.American English
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                         |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#colour#    |color
|[.line-through]#labelling# |labeling
|[.line-through]#analyse#   |analyze
|[.line-through]#centre#    |center
|===

=== Verbs with a special meaning (shall, should, may, can)

* Use these modal verbs to express the level of obligation:

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-modal-verbs]
.Proper modal verbs
[%header, cols="^10,^10,^20", align="right"]
|===
|Level of obligation |Verb to use |Colloquial meaning
|*_Requirement_* |#*shall, +
shall not*# |mandatory statement, +
"it must do/have", +
"it is not allowed to do/have"
|*_Recommendation_* |#*should, +
should not*#|"it is good/bad practice to do/have"
|*_Permission_* |#*may, +
need not*#|"it is allowed to do/have and also allowed not to do/have"
|*_Possibility_*|#*can, +
cannot*#|"it depends on some circumstances if or if not"
|===

NOTE: The differences between these verbs are subtle and sometimes difficult to grasp.
The table <<tab-osc2-writing-guide-modal-verbs, with modal verbs>> is based on ISO guidelines but currently under discussion.
It is possible that the table will be simplified in the future.

=== Keep it short

* Write short sentences.
* If sentences get too long, consider splitting them up into shorter sentences.
* Keep headings short (only one line).

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-shortness]
.Shortness is key
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                                                                                                  |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#3.1 Hints on how to maintain the printer#                                                           |3.1 Printer maintenance
|[.line-through]#Due to the fact that they were able to come to an agreement, a name changing of the file took place.# |The file was renamed.
|===

=== Use present tense

* Present tense is easy to understand.
* Present tense is the preferred tense to express technical facts.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-tense]
.Present tense
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                                    |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#Chapter X will describe the details.# |Chapter X describes the details.
|===

=== Use active voice

* Active voice is easier to understand than passive voice.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-voice]
.Passive voice and active voice
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                                      |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#The variable is set by the user.#       |The user sets the variable.
|[.line-through]#The car is driven to the garage by me.# |I drive the car to the garage.
|===

== Keep it simple

=== Use simple constructs

* Simple constructs require fewer words and are easier to read.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-constructs]
.Simple constructs
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                   |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#in order to#         |to
|[.line-through]#has the possibility# |can
|===

=== Do not use abbreviations

* Some less common abbreviations may confuse the reader.
Avoid them.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-abbreviations]
.No abbreviations
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                    |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#e.g.# |for example
|[.line-through]#i.e.# |meaning
|===

== Be precise

=== Do not use synonyms

* Stick to the same word for an element or concept.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-consistency]
.Use words consistently
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                                                           |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#Press the key. After hitting the button the pop-up appears.# |Press the key. After pressing the key a pop-up appears.
|===

=== Avoid words that are not precise

* Do not use words like "[.line-through]#basically#", "[.line-through]#actually#", "[.line-through]#very#", "[.line-through]#practically#", ...

=== Use 'that' and 'which' correctly

* Use *'that'* and *'which'* to express the information level:
** *_'that'_* adds essential information, no commas are used.
** *_'which'_* adds information that can be left out, commas are used.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-precision]
.Precision matters
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                                             |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#The rule I follow#                             |The rule that I follow
|[.line-through]#The vehicle that is red drives down the road.# |The vehicle, which is red, drives down the road.
|===

== Formatting

=== Consistent formatting

* Stick to *one spelling* for a word that allows several spellings (e-mail, email, E-mail).
* Stick to *one style* to present information (steps always as numbered lists).
* Stick to *one formatting* for a special purpose (first use of technical term: _italic_)

=== Use templates

* Adoc-templates are available for common types of topics.
Use them to create consistent content.
* Each template contains instructions on how to use the template and sample text that has to be replaced.
* Currently available templates:
** <<../template/generic_template.adoc, Generic>>
** <<../template/task_template.adoc, Task>>
** <<../template/uml_element_template.adoc, UML element>>
** <<../template/use_case_template.adoc, Use case>>

=== One sentence per line

* Insert a line break after each sentence.
* No manual line breaks inside sentences.

=> _"Only hit 'enter' after a period ('.'), but make sure to hit 'enter' after a period."_

```
1 This is the first sentence.
2 This is the second sentence.
3 This is the third sentence.
```

=== Use paragraphs

* Use paragraphs to structure your text.
* A new thought or statement requires a new paragraph.
* An empty line creates a new paragraph.

```
1 This is the first sentence of the first paragraph.
2 This is the second sentence of the first paragraph.
3
4 This is the first sentence of the second paragraph.
```

=== Uppercase and lowercase

* In headings and captions only the *first word* begins with an uppercase letter (sentence-style capitalization).
* _Exception_: *Acronyms* and *proper names* are spelled as is.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-headings]
.Use of uppercase in headings and captions
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                             |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#Wrong Formatting of a Heading# |Correct formatting of a heading
|[.line-through]#Asam rules to follow#          |ASAM rules to follow
|[.line-through]#Scope of OpenScenario#         |Scope of OpenSCENARIO
|===

=== File names

* Use only *lowercase* for file and folder names.
* Use the underscore _ instead of 'space' in file and folder names.
* Use `.adoc` as file ending for documents.

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-file-names]
.Use of uppercase and underscores in file and folder names
[%header, cols="^10,^10", align="right"]
|===
|No                                      |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#ExampleFileName.adoc#   |example_file_name.adoc
|[.line-through]#Another file name.adoc# |another_file_name.adoc
|[.line-through]#Writing_guide.adoc#     |writing_guide.adoc
|===

=== Indentation
* Use four space characters per indentation level.
* Do not use tab characters.
* Use the following text editor settings:
** *Tab size: 4*
** *Insert spaces*

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-indentation]
.Four spaces indentation (spaces marked as '.')
[%header, cols="10,10", align="right"]
|===
^|No ^|#Yes#
|Normal text +
[.line-through]#->Level 1 indented text +
->->Level 2 indented text#
|Normal text +
....Level 1 indented text +
........Level 2 indented text
|===

=== Tags

* All topics, figures, tables and code examples shall have a unique tag.
* Sections may also have a tag if a link to the section is needed.
* _Note:_ If you can not come up with a document-wide unique id, just add `[#tag-uid]`.
This triggers a pipeline warning and the technical writer can help you.

```
Examples:
[#top-uid]
[#fig-uid]
[#tab-uid]
[#code-uid]
[#sec-uid]
```

=== Non-normative sections

Text sections (paragraphs or blocks of text) in the documentation of a standard are considered **normative**.

If some text sections should be considered as **non-normative** and only descriptive (for example, background information or examples), mark this sections deliberately as non-normative.

* Non-normative sections shall be marked with the user-defined asciidoc role _non-normative_.

** Put the role attribute `+[.non-normative]+` in front of single paragraphs or blocks to mark them as non-normative.

** Inside a normative section use `+[.non-normative]#<text>#+` to mark single text passages `+<text>+` as non-normative.

[#cod-osc2-writing-guide-normative]
.Example for normative and non-normative sections
[source, adoc]
----
This is a normative paragraph.

[.non-normative]
This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph.

====
This is a normative block.
====

[.non-normative]
====
This is a descriptive block.
====

This is another normative paragraph.
This sentence is normative.
[.non-normative]#This sentence is non-normative.#
This sentence is normative again.
----

* Roles can be combined using the following syntax: `+[.<first_role>.<second_role>]+`.

[#cod-osc2-writing-guide-normative2]
.Example with multiple roles
[source, adoc]
----
[.important.non-normative]
This is a descriptive, non-normative paragraph that is also marked with the important-role.
----

* Id and role attributes can be combined. +
Use the long notation for easier reading: `+[id=<document_id>, role=<document_role>]+`.

[#cod-osc2-writing-guide-normative3]
.Example with role and id combined
[source, adoc]
----
[id=top-doc-unique-id, role=non-normative]
= Document title

This is a descriptive, non-normative document.
----

* The actual format and style of non-normative sections depends on the entry in the CSS style sheet file that is used for rendering the text and is not coded in the adoc-file itself.

[#cod-osc2-writing-guide-css-example]
.Example of a CSS entry for non-normative text
[source, css]
----
.non-normative { font-style: italic; color: darkgreen; background: gold }
----


== Additional elements

=== Lists

* Lists are a great way to present lots of similar information in a compact form.
* Use the same word/sentence structure for all list items.
* Use *numbered lists* (Asciidoc '*.*') for steps that require a specific order.
* Use *bullet points* (Asciidoc '***') for enumerations and elements that do not require a specific order.

.A numbered list example
```
. First step
. Second step
. Third step
```

. First step
. Second step
. Third step

[#tab-osc2-writing-guide-list-example]
.Bullet point list example 'ingredients'
[%header, cols="10a,10a", align="right"]
|===
|No |#Yes#
|* [.line-through]#first 2 apples,# +
* [.line-through]#then one banana.# +
* [.line-through]#And you need an orange too!#
|* two apples +
* one banana +
* one orange
|===

=== Figures

Figures, like pictures or drawings, may be used to illustrate complex facts.

* Preferred format: `.svg`
* Figures are stored in a subfolder named `images` located inside the chapter folder.
* Each figure shall have:
** a tag
** a caption
** the link to the picture
** an alternative text

```
[#fig-uuid]
.This is the caption of the figure
image::./images/logo.png[an alternative text]
```

[#fig-uuid]
.This is the caption of the figure
image::./images/logo.png[an alternative text]

=== Tables

* Use tables if you have to present a huge amount of similar data in a very compressed form.
* A table shall have:
** a tag
** a caption

```
[#tab-uuid]
.This is the caption of the table
|===
|cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3
|cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3
|cell 3_1 | cell 3_2 | cell 3_3
|===
```

[#tab-uuid]
.This is the caption of the table
|===
|cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3
|cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3
|cell 3_1 | cell 3_2 | cell 3_3
|===

=== Special characters

Sometimes you may need to display a character that is reserved for adoc-formatting.
Here is how to do it.

* *Underscore (&lowbar;)* +
Use `+&lowbar;+` to display an underscore.
* *Pound sign (&#35;)* +
Use `+&#35;+` to display a pound sign.
* *Protected space ({nbsp})* +
Use `+{nbsp}+` to define a space character is not used for automatic line breaks. +
This is especially useful for value-unit-pairs like `+5{nbsp}m/s+` (5{nbsp}m/s) to ensure that value and unit are always in the same line of text.

== Source code

Consider one of the following possibilities if you want to add source code examples to an adoc topic.

. You may use small bits of code as an *inline literal* directly inside your text.
. You may add source code as a *fragment* from a source code file by reference.
. You may copy and paste source code directly as a *snippet* into the adoc topic.

=== Inline literals

For very small bits of code using *inline literals* is the most convenient way to add source code examples.
This type of including source code is especially useful if you want to highlight single code elements like methods or class names.

==== Changes in the adoc file

Enclose the source code in a *pair of pluses surrounded by a pair of backticks*, like this:

 Call the `+source_example_func()+` for the result.

==== Result
The previous line looks like this as adoc output:

Call the `+source_example_func()+` for the result.

=== Source code fragments

You can add source code as a *fragment* from a source code file if you would like to reference to the source code within the source code file.

There are several advantages of using fragments:

* You do not need to copy the source code into the documentation.
* You are referencing to the single point of truth, which is the source code file.
* If you apply changes to the source code file, these changes are automatically applied to your documentation.

Follow these steps to add source code fragments to your documentation:

. Add source comment tags at the beginning and the end of the part of code you want to use in your code block.
. Use this tag to include the fragment into the adoc documentation.

The example in the following subchapters uses the tag `exampleInclude` to add a code fragment.

==== Changes in the source code file

[#code-tags-in-source-file]
.Tags for the inclusion of source code from a source code file
[source, osc2]
----
[...]
// tag::exampleInclude[]    <1> <2>
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
    const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit;
    dolor = sit - amet(dolor);
    return sit ? consectetur(ipsum, 0, dolor < 0 ? 0 : dolor) : [];
}
// end::exampleInclude[]    <3>
[...]
----

<1> To indicate the start of a tagged region in the source code file, insert a comment line in the source code.
<2> Assign a name to the tag directive.
In this example, the tag is named `exampleInclude`.
<3> Insert another comment line where you want the tagged region to end.

==== Changes in the adoc file

....
[#code-example-code-block-tag]    <1>
.ASAM example code block included by tags    <2>
[source, osc2]    <3>
----    <4>
include::../resources/examplecode.js[tags=exampleInclude]    <5>
----    <6>
....

<1> Insert an anchor for the code block
You can reference this anchor using \<<code-example-code-block-tag>>
<2> Insert a caption for the code block.
<3> Define the source code language for code highlighting.
For example, `osc2`, `xml`, or `java`.
<4> Insert a code block delimiter.
<5> Directly include the source code within the source code file with a tag marking fragment.
<6> Insert a code block delimiter.

NOTE: For more information see the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-tagged-regions/[Asciidoctor reference].

==== Result

This is how the reference looks like inside the adoc file:

[#code-example-code-block-tag]
.ASAM example code block included by tags
[source, osc2]
----
include::../resources/examplecode.js[tags=exampleInclude]
----

=== Source code snippets

You can add source code as a *snippet* into your adoc documentation if you cannot or if you do not want to reference to the source code file.
Be aware that you have to maintain two places (your original code and the snippet in the adoc) in case of future changes.

Follow these steps to use source code as a snippet:

. Copy the part of source code you want to use as a snippet.
. Paste the snippet into your adoc file.
. Insert an anchor, a caption, the highlighting info and delimiters as shown in the following subchapter.

==== Changes in the adoc file
....
[#code-example-code-block]    <1>
.ASAM example code block included in an asciidoc file    <2>
[source, osc2]    <3>
----    <4>
<ParameterDeclarations>    <5>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$HostVehicle" parameterType="string" value="car_white"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$TargetVehicle" parameterType="string" value="car_red"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$EgoStartS" parameterType="double" value="50"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$HeadwayTime_LaneChange" parameterType="double" value="0.4"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$HeadwayTime_Brake" parameterType="double" value="1.0"/>
</ParameterDeclarations>
----    <6>
....
<1> Insert an anchor for the code block.
Reference this anchor using \<<code-example-code-block>>
<2> Insert a caption for the code block.
<3> Define the source code language for code highlighting.
For example, `osc2`, `xml`, or `java`.
<4> Insert a code block delimiter.
<5> Insert the code block.
<6> Insert a code block delimiter.

==== Result

This is how the correctly configured snippet looks like in the adoc file:

[#code-example-code-block]
.ASAM example code block included in an asciidoc file
[source, osc2]
----
<ParameterDeclarations>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$HostVehicle" parameterType="string" value="car_white"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$TargetVehicle" parameterType="string" value="car_red"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$EgoStartS" parameterType="double" value="50"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$HeadwayTime_LaneChange" parameterType="double" value="0.4"/>
  <ParameterDeclaration name="$HeadwayTime_Brake" parameterType="double" value="1.0"/>
</ParameterDeclarations>
----
=== Source code type 'osc2'
Use #[source, osc2]# as a source block identifier for fragments and snippets (see <<code-example-code-block, example>>) to define the language type as 'osc2'.
This enables future automatic syntax highlighting.

== Review process and draft-attribute

The project uses the adoc attribute `draft` to steer the review process.
This FAQ helps you to manage the review and attribute handling.

=== Purpose of the draft-attribute

Q1 What is this draft-attribute for?::
New content on the master branch has to be marked with the `ifdef::draft[] - endif::draft[]` 'feature flag' mechanism.
New content in this case means content in adoc files that is not already reviewed and agreed on, like newly merged text from a development branch. +
+
A typical adoc topic looks like this:

[source]
```
  [#top-an-example-topic]
  = Topic heading

  ifdef::draft[]

  Some content that is new or still needs
  to be reviewed and agreed on.

  endif::draft[]

  Some other content that is already reviewed and
  ready for being part of the standard documentation.
```

When a review is started, a WG-Lead or a member of the CCB removes the draft-mechanism for the part that has to be reviewed in the review merge request.


=== Preview configuration

Q2 I cannot see my content in the preview. What is wrong?::
You may experience an empty preview in your editor when editing files that contain the mechanism. +
+
This is actually a good sign.
The preview is working correctly and hides all parts marked as draft. +
+
To make the parts visible again, you have to set the attribute `draft` for your preview window.

==== VisualStudioCode with Asciidoc extension

. In the Asciidoc extension settings go to `Preview:Attributes - Edit in settings.json`.
. In the settings.json add the `draft` attribute:

    "asciidoc.preview.attributes": {
      "draft": ""
    }

. Save settings.json

==== AsciidocFX preview

. Go to `Settings` on the right hand side of the preview
. Go to the `Preview settings` tab
. Add an `Asciidoctor Attribute` by double-clicking an empty attribute line
. Add attribute `draft` with value `true`
. Save the settings (small button on the lower left of the tab!)
. Reload the preview

Other tools should have similar settings.

==== Gitlab preview

The preview in Gitlab intentionally shows the release version of the files, meaning that the parts marked as draft are hidden.
You can easily switch off the preview and view the source content by clicking on the display source-icon on top of the file window:

[#fig-osc2-writing-guide-source-view]
.How to switch to source-view in Gitlab
image::./images/source_view.png[Source view icon location]
The icon next to it switches back to the preview.


=== Pipeline artifacts as reference
Q3 My preview looks fine. Why do I get feedback that something is not formatted correctly?::
Please note that all the previews described in this chapter are just for your convenience. +
*The only reliable documents for reviews are the html-artifacts generated by the CI-pipeline!* +
These artifacts are linked at the beginning of review merge requests.
You can also download the artifacts directly from the pipeline result page.
