== Recommended Extensions

VSCode is already without extensions very powerful and user friendly. One thing that can make the VSCode experience even better are the extensions. There is a list of extensions we recommend that will make your life contributing to the ASAM standards way easier.

Installing an extension is really easy, just enter the extension menu (<<Interface>> see below where to find that), search for the desired extension. Than click on the Install-Button.
