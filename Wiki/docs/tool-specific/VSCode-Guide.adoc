== Recommended Extensions

VSCode is already without extensions very powerful and user friendly. One thing that can make the VSCode experience even better are the extensions. There is a list of extensions we recommend that will make your life contributing to the ASAM standards way easier.

Installing an extension is really easy, just enter the extension menu (<<Interface>> see below where to find that), search for the desired extension. Than click on the Install-Button. 

=== AsciiDoc

The AsciiDoc extension will add the syntax the asciidoc interpreter to VSCode so you can use the preview feature and have syntax highlighting.

=== GitGraph

The GitGraph extension is a great tool navigating the branches in the git repository and provides a great overview.

=== GitLens

The GitLens Extension is a great extension to follow up on all the changes made to the documents within the repository.
Gitlens provides:

* Repository Overview
* File History
* Line History
* Commit Comparison

=== Comment Anchors

The Comment Anchor extension provides you with the ability of adding highlighted keywords to the raw text.

The extension also lets you search for all available anchors in the repository or current file and offers a jump-to option.

== Interacting with Git

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support

== Command Palette

* Ctrl+Shift+P brings up the Command Palette. 

* From here, you have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.

== Activity Bar
// Explorer - shows all of the files and folders you have access to
// Search – Find and replace in files
// Git – all git related commands, only active if in a git repository
// Extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.

== Adding VSCode support for diagrams (including preview)

The kroki extension supports a wide range of diagrams from BPMN to Graphviz to PlantUML and Vega graphs using kroki and asciidoctor-kroki.

You can see the full range and examples on the https://kroki.io/examples.html[website].

This requires a diagram server. There are multiple options:

. use the public kroki.io server
. deploy your own server
. https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[run a kroki docker container] on your local machine

We will go with option 1


WARNING: This extension will send graph information to https://kroki.io. If this is an issue it is also possible to use your own kroki instance (see https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[here for more information]).

To enable diagram support, set the use_kroki parameter in your User Settings to true.

image::enable_kroki.gif[]

To cache and save diagrams locally set the kroki-fetch-diagram attribute in your document header:

    = My Amazing Document
    :kroki-fetch-diagram:
    This will store images by default in your document folder, however you may also set imagesdir to store them elsewhere:

    = My Amazing Document
    :kroki-fetch-diagram:
    :imagesdir: media


The images are served over http:// and you must allow your preview to include data from unsafe sources. To do this open your command palette (ctrl+shift+P) and enter ``asciidoc preview security`` and choose ``Allow insecure content``.

.allow insecure content

Now you can test this with examples:
