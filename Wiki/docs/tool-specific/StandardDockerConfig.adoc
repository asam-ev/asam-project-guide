== Standard Docker-Compose Instructions
. Create a new `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of the project.
. Add the following content to the created file: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: "2"

services:
  asciidoctor:
    image: asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor
    volumes:
      - .:/documents
    entrypoint: asciidoctor --failure-level WARN -r asciidoctor-diagram -a mathjax -r asciidoctor-bibtex --trace standard/main.adoc -o HTML_standard_local_build.html

---- 
+
. Run docker-compose with `docker-compose run asciidoctor`

NOTE: The only adaption that may be required is to change the input file (`standard/main.adoc`). This is the same for every project. All the configuration required is in the docker-compose.yml.

TIP: It is also possible to include the running of scripts into this (e.g. adoc2LOFT)
