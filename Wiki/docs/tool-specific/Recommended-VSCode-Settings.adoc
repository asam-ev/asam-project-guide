= ASAM Recommended Visual Studio Code Settings
:imagesdir: ../images

This is a summary of recommended VSCode settings to follow writing guidelines easier.

== Indentations
* Insert 4 spaces instead of tabs. The Writing guide does not allow any tabs.
I am not sure if "editor.tabSize": 4 is enough (see here).

== Automatic Removal Of Spaces After Periods
* When saving the file, remove spaces after periods automatically. According to the Writing guide, there should be a line break after each sentence. No additional space after a period is required. Seems like the setting "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true is enough.

== Enabling Kroki Support In AsciiDoc

The AsciiDoc extension for Visual Studio Code (see xref:Recommended-VSCode-Extensions.adoc#AsciiDoc[Recommended Visual Studio Code Extensions]) comes with the ability to include Kroki diagrams. However, it is deactivated by default and must be configured before first use.

This requires a diagram server. There are multiple options:

. use the public kroki.io server
. deploy your own server
. https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[run a kroki docker container] on your local machine

We will go with option 1.

WARNING: This extension will send graph information to https://kroki.io. If this is an issue, it is also possible to use your own kroki instance (see https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[here for more information]).

To enable diagram support, set the use_kroki parameter in your User Settings to true.
