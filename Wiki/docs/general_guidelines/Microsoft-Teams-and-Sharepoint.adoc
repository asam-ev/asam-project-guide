== Access

WARNING: If you do not yet have access to Teams and have not been in touch with mailto:benjamin.engel@asam.net[me], please do so! 


== Teams & Sharepoint

* Each channel in Teams has a "chat" tab for chatting & a "files" tab to share files
** If you need another Teams channel, let me know!
* These files tabs can also be found directly in Sharepoint (sign in with your microsoft account)

NOTE: Sharepoint is a Microsoft service that is used in the background by Teams to manage the files. This is why you can either access the files in Teams or directly in Sharepoint as it is essentially the same thing.

== Sharepoint links 

WARNING: These links will only work for you if you have access to the corresponding project!
