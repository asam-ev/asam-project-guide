For the development of standards, __{asam}__ provides <<collaborative_infrastructure,**collaborative infrastructure**>> and recommends the use of others (<<recommended_tools_table,**recommended tools**>>) to interact and more easily contribute to the standard development.
All of the listed infrastructure elements are required for the standard development.
Depending on the personal role within a project, the frequency of usage may differ.
Nevertheless, being familiar on how to use the given infrastructure will enable you to contribute to the standard development.
For more information on whether a tool is mandatory for your role, check out xref:role-specific:home.adoc[].

// == Infrastructure for Standard Development
// Most of the <<collaborative_infrastructure,**infrastructure**>> is hosted by ASAM and can be accessed through a browser directly without the need to install them locally.
// However, some tools may be set up on the user's computer as well for easier access.

// include::tooling:partial$list-of-tools.adoc[tag=mandatory]

// == Recommended Tools
// All <<recommended_tools_table,**recommended tools**>> are optional.
// Each user may decide whether to use these tools, use alternatives, or just use the appropriate features in the webhosted counterpart in the infrastructure.
// However, ASAM provides a set of instructions, how-tos, guides and other information on working with these recommended tools in ASAM projects that will not be available for alternative tools and methods.
