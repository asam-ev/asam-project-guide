Major version developments of ASAM standards introduce significant changes to  the  standard.  
// end::short[]
Major version  development projects meet one or more of the following criteria:

* Addition of a new, major feature.
* Significant changes to existing features.

It is expected that the implementation of the new ver-sion will require significant development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users alike.
A new major version of an ASAM standard does not have to be backward-compatible to its predecessor versions.
The number of major version releases meets the pattern:
"X.0.0". X is an integer number starting with 2.
