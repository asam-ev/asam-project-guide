Study projects provide members an organizational structure to study or analyze specific aspects of ASAM standards in a collaborative way. 
Study projects have the overall goal to enhance the understanding of ASAM standards among the participants, to promote their application in member companies and to create change requests for the further development of ASAM standards. 
This project type is specifically intended for members in regions, where ASAM standards are not well known. 
The content of study projects can be, but is not limited to:

* collaborative self-study of an ASAM standard
* receive training on an ASAM standard
* carry out a suitability analysis of an ASAM standard against defined use-cases
* carry out a pilot project to become familiar with the practical application of ASAM-related tools
* carry out an interoperability analysis of ASAM-related tools

Study projects have no expected deliverables other than a final report. The members of study projects shall be pledged to submit change requests, if they find issues or gaps in ASAM standards.

The standard development process does not apply for study projects in case that either no budget or a small budget is needed. 
The process to request, approve and carrying out a study project is:

. Member submits a study project information sheet to the ASAM Office for project approval.
. ASAM Office checks the information and approves or rejects the project.
. ASAM Office informs the TSC about the project.
. ASAM Office publishes an announcement of the project.
. The study project starts and is being carried out as described in the study project in-formation sheet. 
. The ASAM Office monitors the project activities.

Some further rules apply for study projects:

* Participation in study projects is open for all ASAM members, e.g. also to members in a non "active"membership class.
* Participation in a study project can be restricted to members of a specific region, e.g. Japan only.
* The working language can be different than English.
* The project members elect a project leader.
* Meetings are documented via meeting minutes in English language. The minutes may be translated into the working language of the study group. 
* The project members use the ASAM IT infrastructure.

Upon request, ASAM provides funding for study projects up to the limit for small budget projects.

In case that a larger budget is required beyond the limit of a small budget project, then the project must be requested via the regular project proposal process, which consist of the process steps P2 Proposal Writing, P3 Proposal Submission, P4 Proposal Publication and P5 Proposal Decision by the TSC.
