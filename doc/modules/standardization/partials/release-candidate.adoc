// end::table[]
The project group prepares a release candidate and agrees per formal voting to submit the candidate to the {tsc} for release decision.
Each company has one vote.
The release candidate is accepted by absolute two-thirds majority.
The group's decision is documented in the meeting minutes.

The project leader submits the following deliverables to ASAM:

- the standard with all supplemental documents, files and examples that constitute the deliverables to members.
- sources required to generate the deliverables, including written instructions how to generate them.
- revision history documentation (not needed for version 1.0.0).
- new release presentation.

Sources are those digital work products, which can be modified or edited with standard tools such as text editors, image processors or modeling tools, and which are the input for generators that produce the final deliverables.
