The convergence of the automotive markets with new trends in digitation, autonomous driving, alternative propulsion, and vehicle as a service as enabled by new IT business models provides many new technical concepts that can be standardized in ASAM.
Standardization requires three components:

* A technical concept
* A market need for the standard
* Passonate, technical experts who convene at reguaral intervals to define the requirements and the implementation

To make sure that these three requirements are met, ASAM has launched this ideation platform.

Technical experts from all over the globe can post concepts and ideas, receive feedback, and drive new standardization topics.
This is how it works:

. Send an email with your concept, idea, question or feedback to ideation@asam.net
. The ASAM Office will contact you to clarify the details (or answer your questions)
. It must be investigated if there are any other standards or standardization projects in that area
. The ASAM Office will then post the mutually agreed concept
. ASAM Members world-wide will be able to comment on the idea, and enroll in an ideation project

When enough interest is raised (subject to suitable market relevance), ASAM will host a workshop to further develop the topic.
If required, an ideation project is being set-up that will meet regularly.
The final goal is to transfer the idea into the regular Standards Development Process.
