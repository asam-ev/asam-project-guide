Minor version developments of ASAM standards introduce  changes  to  existing  features  on  a  smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard. 
// end::short[]
Minor version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria:

* Addition of new features, which are considered as small relative to existing features.
* Insignificant changes or additions to existing features.

It  is  expected  that  the  implementation  of  the  new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users. 
A new minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version. 
Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard.
The number of minor version releases meets the pattern: 
"?.X.0". X is an integer number starting with 1. ? is the current major release number.
The following process steps are not mandatory and are skipped by default, unless otherwise decided by the TSC or the project group:

* P1: ProposalWorkshop
* C: Review Phase
