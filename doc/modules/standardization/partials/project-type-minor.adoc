A minor version development project introduces changes to existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard.
It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users.
A minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor.
Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard.

Minor version developments of ASAM standards introduce changes t existing features on a smaller scale or introduce new features that are rather small relative to the rest of the standard.

Minor version development projects meet one or more of the following criteria:

* Addition of new features, which are considered as small relative to existing features.
* Insignificant changes or additions to existing features.

It is expected that the implementation of the new version will require low development or migration efforts by tool vendors and end users.

A new minor version of an ASAM standard shall be backward-compatible to its immediate predecessor version.
Exceptions are allowed, require approval from the TSC and must be documented in the standard.

The number of minor version releases meets the pattern:
"?.X.0".
X is an integer number starting with 1.
? is the current major release number.

The following process steps are not mandatory and are skipped by default, unless otherwise decided by the TSC or the project group:

* P1: ProposalWorkshop
* C: Review Phase
