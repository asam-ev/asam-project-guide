Start the development of a completely new standard within ASAM.

The development project meets one of the following criteria:

* There exists no predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio.
* A predecessor in the ASAM standard portfolio was deprecated and a new standard in the same technology area shall be developed from scratch.
* The new standard is an extension, substitution or parallel development of a standard from another standardization organization.

A new ASAM standard gets the version number "1.0.0".If a new standard replaces a deprecated standard, then the new standard cannot have the same name than the deprecated standard.
