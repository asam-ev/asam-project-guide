ASAM standardization activities are organized in projects.
They are a temporary endeavor of ASAM members undertaken to develop or modify a standard with a defined beginning, a defined end and defined resources.

ASAM projects are carried out via the ASAM standard development process.
This process consists of five phases and a total of up to fifteen process steps, as described in the next subchapters:

* **I**: {ideation-phase}
* **P**: {proposal-phase}
* **D**: {development-phase}
* **C**: {review-phase}
* **R**: {release-phase}
