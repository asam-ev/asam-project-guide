Decisions on release candidates are put on the agenda of the next available TSC meeting.
Release candidate decisions are handled during the meeting via a three-step process:

. Project leader presents the release candidate to the TSC members.
. TSC members are given the opportunity to ask questions.
. TSC members discuss the proposal (without project leader's presence) and then proceed with casting their votes on the release.

The TSC does not modify the content of the release candidate.
If this is deemed to be necessary, then the release shall be rejected.

The voting is carried out in accordance with the TSC voting rules.
The Board Representative for the TSC has to confirm the TSC decision.

The TSC may add requirements for rework of the release candidate and make the release contingent upon the completion of the required rework.
The Office shall check the reworked release candidate submission.
If the required rework has been implemented as defined by the TSC, then the release is effective and the release process continues.
