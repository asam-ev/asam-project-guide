// end::table[]
The project group has the obligation to review each review feedback and make a decision on how to further work on it.
The decision includes as a minimum the status "accepted", "rejected" or "deferred".
The decision must be documented.

Accepted feedback shall be implemented.
The project group has full authority how to im-plement the reviewers' feedback into the standard.
They can implement changes as pro-posed by the reviewer, or decide for a different implementation.

If a reviewer's feedback is actually out-of-scope, since it contains a request to consider a new use-case, feature or requirement, then the feedback shall be rejected and transferred to the ASAM CR-system with status "new".

ASAM has the obligation to inform reviewers about the status of their review feedback, upon their request.
