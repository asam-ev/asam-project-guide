Participants of the Proposal Workshop focus on the following topics, which are the technical core of the intended project proposal:

. Use-cases, from the view-point of end-users.
. Features, which shall be standardized.
. Requirements, to be considered during the development of the standard.

Further items shall be discussed, which cover the proposal justification and project planning:

- prioritization of features and requirements.
- statement about backward-compatibility, in case of the further development of an existing standard.

The participants of the Proposal Workshop shall determine the proposal submitter.

The Office is responsible for the preparation and carrying out of the Proposal Workshop.
This is done in close cooperation with the member(s), who initiated the process and are the major drivers of the idea.

The Office sends out a public invitation for the Proposal Workshop at least four weeks prior to the event with a brief description of the goals and content of the proposed project.
The Office informs the {tsc}.

Proposal Workshops are open to all ASAM members.
Non-members can participate upon invitation by the Office.

By default, the Office moderates the workshop.
This task can be passed to a member, if appropriate.

If there is significant interest in the proposed project in different regions (primarily in North America, Europe, East Asia), then the Office organizes meetings in a way that equally allows all members from those regions to influence the results of the Proposal Workshop.

The results of the Proposal Workshop are documented in meeting minutes, which are sent out to all participants after the meeting.
