Description:: Concept projects have the purpose to prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards.
They are typically chosen when the envisioned standard is complex and requires significant resources to even develop a sound and solid project proposal.
Goal:: The goals of concept projects are to propose specific content for ASAM standards and/or to provide justification for the usefulness, practicability, and feasibility of the proposed content.

Concept projects have the purpose to prepare the further development of existing ASAM standards or to prepare the development of new ASAM standards.

The goals of concept projects are:

. to propose specific content for ASAM standards
. to provide justification or proof for the usefulness, practicability and feasibility of the proposals

In order to reach the goals and to enable the project group to develop specific content proposals, concept projects may include some of the following methods:

* feasibility study
* requirements evaluation
* technology survey
* development of a prototype
* carrying out performance benchmarks

The minimum deliverable of a concept project must be a concept paper.
The paper shall include the findings of the project group and proposals for ASAM standards.
Proposals for ASAM standards shall be as specific as possible.
Ideally, the concept project documents their proposals in a copy & past ready format, as it could be taken over into the respective ASAM standard.
Upon request, ASAM provides funding for concept projects up to 75% of the total required project budget.Concept projects are carried out via the standard development process.
The following process steps are not mandatory and are skipped by default, unless otherwise decided by the __{tsc}__ or the project group:

* P1: Proposal Workshop
* C: Review Phase
* R: Release Phase

The project group still caries out an R1 Technical Release and submits their deliverables to the __{tsc}__.
The __{tsc}__ reviews the deliverables and determines, whether the project objectives have been reached and the project is closed.
