ASAM standardization activities are organized in projects.
They are a temporary endeavor of ASAM members undertaken to develop or modify a standard with a defined beginning, a defined end and defined resources.

ASAM projects are carried out via the ASAM standard development process.
This process consists of four phases and a total of up to fifteen process steps, as described in the next subchapters:

include::partial$asam-processes.adoc[tag=short]

The description of the ASAM standard development process in this chapter contains all formal process steps to develop an ASAM standard.
The process steps are mandatory for the development of new standards and the development of a major version of an existing ASAM standard.
For all other project types, some of the process steps are optional, which is further documented in Chapter 2 Project Types.

This process description focuses on the ideal and best-case course of an ASAM project.
Real projects may have iterations, loops and interventions by the TSC, Office, or Board of Directors.
Project groups may decide to re-start a project with an updated project proposal, upgrade to a higher release level, or to prematurely end the project.
While those events can occur and need to be appropriately managed, they are out-of-scope for this guideline document.
