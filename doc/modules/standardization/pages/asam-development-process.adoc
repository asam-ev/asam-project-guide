ASAM standards are developed and maintained within projects. The main contributors to projects are volunteer experts from its member companies, supported by the ASAM office and an optional, ASAM-funded service provider. ASAM provides the complete framework for the project group, including guidelines, templates, IT infrastructure, a project budget, administrative support and worldwide marketing.
