The convergence of the automotive markets with new trends in digitation, autonomous driving, alternative propulsion, and vehicle as a service as enabled by new IT business models provides many new technical concepts that can be standardized in ASAM.


ASAM has launched this ideation platform to address topics and challenges that may benefit from standardization, and to get a feeling for their market relevance.
We invite you to send us your ideas, share your expertise, and address your requirements.
