ASAM standards are used by companies, who are either members of __{asam}__ or buyers of the standards.
If a standard has a known problem, then members generally have the expectation that the known problem is fixed within a reasonable time.
Buyers of ASAM standards have, in accordance with the German civil code BGB, the right of supplementary performance (ger. Nacherf√ºllung) if the standard has a known problem.

The issue resolution process shall ensure that member expectations are met and the legal rights of buyers are fulfilled within a predictable period of time and for all standards.

== Scope
This process is limited to resolve technical issues of ASAM standards.
Issues in the context of this process have one of the following characteristics:

* Error: unintended or wrong content.
* Contradiction: inconsistent or contradictory content.
* Specification gap: missing content required for a functional system and for com-plete understanding.
* Lack of clarity: Unclear, vague or ambiguous description, which leads to misun-derstandings and misinterpretations.

The issue may exist in the xref:compendium:definitions/base_standard.adoc[base standard], in xref:compendium:definitions/associated_standard.adoc[associate standards], schema files, interface definition files, model files, examples or any other supplements of the standard.

The request of a new feature or modification of an existing feature, independent of its declared urgency and importance, is not an issue handled through this process.

== Roles
Several parties are involved in carrying out the issue resolution process.

=== Standard user
include::role-specific:page$standard_user.adoc[tags=issue_resolution]

=== Standard manager
include::role-specific:page$standard_manager.adoc[tags=issue_resolution]

=== Standard expert group
include::role-specific:page$standard_expert-group.adoc[tags=issue_resolution]

=== TSC
include::role-specific:page$tsc.adoc[tags=issue_resolution]

== Process
__{asam}__ experiences a continuous and spontaneous influx of support requests for its stand-ards.
1st-Level Support together with the Standard Manager has the overall task to bring structure into this activity and answer the support requests.
In case that a support request reveals an issue with an ASAM standard, the following issue resolution process shall be carried out.

The process consist of three phases.
The time between the reported issue and its resolution through a revised release of the standard shall not exceed 6 months.
If the involved parties decide not to resolve the issue, then the process ends in phase 2 and is significantly shorter.

If the issue shall be resolved via a new release of the standard, then the outcome of this process can only be a revision release (third digit of the version number).
Changes that would render the standard incompatible to earlier versions, introduction of new features or major rework that spans over multiple pages and chapters, cannot be implemented through this process.

Phases 2 and 3 of the issue resolution process are suspended during the time, when a project group works on the further development of the standard.
During this time, the project group is in charge of handling all reported issues.
The Standard Manager will only work on technical support during this period.
It is recommended that they are a member of the project group.

=== Phase 1: Technical Support
[horizontal]
1.1:: The user of an ASAM standard contacts ASAM technical support with a technical ques-tion or a request.
1.2:: First-level support processes the support request.
If the first-level supporter identifies a feature request or an issue with the standard, then the request shall be forwarded to the Standard Manager (i.e. 2nd-level support) for further processing.
1.3:: The Standard Manager determines, whether the support request shall be entered as a CR in __{asam}__'s CR database and determines its category as
+
* feature request, or
* issue report.

If the CR is of the category "issue report", then the Standard Manager creates an entry in the LOKI document, too.
They also write an answer for the support request.
Members of the Standard Expert Group are automatically notified about each new CR.
They may object, if a CR has been incorrectly categorized.

=== Phase 2: Issue Resolution
[horizontal]
2.1:: The Standard Manager carries out the issue resolution phase two times per year at most.
For each known issue, the Standard Manager creates a specific proposal how to fix the issue.
The proposal is copy-and-paste-ready to be implemented into the standard.
2.2:: The Standard Manager calls for a Standard Expert Group meeting.
They organize and moderates the meeting.
The group reviews each CR categorized as an "issue report".
They present his proposals for resolution of the issues and receives technical advice from the members of the group.
The members of the Standard Expert Group have the final decision authority about how to handle each issue.
Besides accepting the proposal of the Standard Manager, the Standard Expert Group can also decide to leave an issue unresolved or to defer the resolution to a standard development project.
In both cases, the decision must be well reasoned, and the reason is published in the LOKI.
In case of deferring the issue res-olution to a project, a member of the Standard Expert Group must commit to submit a project proposal for this purpose.
2.3:: The Standard Manager creates a new revision of the standard based upon the decisions and technical advice from the Standard Expert Group members.
2.4:: The Standard Manager sends out the revised standard to the Standard Expert Group members for review.
They collect the review feedback and makes necessary changes to the revision version.
2.5:: Once the review iterations are finished, the Standard Manager calls the Standard Expert Group members to cast their votes on the technical release of the revised standard.

=== Phase 3: Release
[horizontal]
3.1:: The Standard Manager submits the revised standard to the __{tsc}__ for public release.
The release process is the same as described in chapter 1.4 "Release Phase".
Correction sheets can be published immediately after the technical release from the Standard Expert Group.
The __{tsc}__ confirms in its next meeting the release.
