To contribute to a Project Proposal, project members can either <<How to contribute to a proposal through GitLab issues,contribute through GitLab issues>> or <<How to contribute to a proposal directly in AsciiDoc files,contribute directly in AsciiDoc>>. +
Both can be performed xref:tooling:working-without-software-installation.adoc[without software installation] directly through the xref:compendium:tools/gitlab/gitlab-ide_guide.adoc[Gitlab IDE].
However, if you prefer to work on your local computer, ASAM recommends using xref:tooling:git.adoc[Git] and xref:tooling:vscode.adoc[Visual Studio Code].
