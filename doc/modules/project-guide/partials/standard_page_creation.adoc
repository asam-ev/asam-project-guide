{add-file-icon}

== Context
In order to make documented {page_reason}s easier to understand, it is necessary to have a standard format for {page_reason}s in which they are written.
For this purpose, the xref:project-guide:attachment${page_template_name}[{page_template_name}] file was created.
Each {page_reason} that is documented in this Project Guide shall use the {page_template_alt_name}.

NOTE: If you want to define a reusable content, consider using a xref:adding_content/add-a-partial.adoc[Partial] instead.
See xref:adding_content/pages-vs-partials.adoc[] for more information on the difference between those two.

== Result
A {page_reason} is created that follows the ASAM {page_template_alt_name}.

== Prerequisites
none

== How
IMPORTANT: These instructions already include the requirements of https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/standard-page/[Creating A Standard Page^] by Antora implicitely.
However, if one deviates from this guide here, the Antora restrictions and requirements still apply!

. Find the module you want your page to be located in.
+
TIP: This should be the module which it relates to most closely.
See other pages in the modules in question for reference.
You can also look at the xref:structure/content_structure.adoc[] for the Project Guide.

. Create your file in the "pages" folder or move it there
.. Alternatively, create a new folder and/or add your file to an existing folder within the "pages" folder if you want to add a structure within the module.
+
TIP: You can copy the xref:project-guide:attachment${page_template_name}[template file] from the examples folder in the project-guide module folder.

. Add the following standard content to your file and modify it accordingly:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
include::project-guide:attachment${page_template_name}[]
----
+
NOTE: Remove the backslash in the template file before the include instruction when you copy the template file directly.
