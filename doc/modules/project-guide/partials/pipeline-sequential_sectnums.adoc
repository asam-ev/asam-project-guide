By default, Antora does not support sequential page numbering.
However, standards at ASAM require to have numbered sections and chapters.
In Antora, these chapters correspond to pages.
Depending on how the standard is structured, sections may be sections in pages or even be their own pages.

To fulfill this requirement, the "Page numbering" extension features were implemented.
These consist of an Antora part (responsible for the navigation structure and sequential numbering over all files) and an Asciidoctor part (responsible for applying the determined page offset on all level two ("== ") sections on each page).

[NOTE]
====
Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for xref:project-guide:extensions/pipeline-sequential_figs_tables.adoc[sequential figure and table numbers].

//tag::how[]
The ASAM Antora extension, in combination with the sectnumsoffset_antora extension for Asciidoctor, creates sequential page and section numbers in Antora. +
To use this feature, add `numbered_titles: true` to the Antora extension configuration.
The `sectnums` attribute must be set on each page where the extension shall apply the sequential numbering.
`sectnums` can also be defined per component (in the component's "antora.yml") or globally (in the site's "site.yml"), depending on the use-case.

The order can also be manually changed by adding the attributes `:sectnumoffset:` and/or `:titleoffset:` to the page or a section therein.
When using a manual override, the offset must be defined as `<number>(.<number>.(...))`. +
Example: `:titleoffset: 2.3.` would set the page number to "2.3." and the first section therein to "2.3.1".

In addition to that, some general actions can be added as attributes in the navigation files.

[horizontal]
`:start-level:`:: Defines the level in the bullet point list from which on the sequential numbers are added.
By default, this is set to 1, meaning that every item starting with "\*" or higher will be included.
If set to a higher number, page title numbers will only be added from that level onward.
For example, if it is set to 3, all bullet points "\*" and "\*\*" will be excluded and counting starts with the first element of "\*\*\*".
`:reset-level-offset:`:: Resets the counter back to the start value.
`:sectnums!:`:: Deactivate section numbers for the next bullet point.
`[preface]`:: Disables section and title numbers for the next bullet point in the list and adds the `[preface]` role to the referenced page, if possible.
Note that this has no immediate effect since `[preface]` is not supported in the document type article that is mandatory for Antora!
`[appendix]`:: Sets section and title numbers to start with capital letters.
Page titles get a prefix of `\{appendix-caption} \{appendix-letter}: `, where `\{appendix-caption}` is the chosen Asciidoctor https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/appendix/#caption[appendix caption^] (default: "Appendix") and `\{appendix-letter}` the next available letter in the alphabet for the appendix (start value: "A").
`[bibliography]`:: Disables section and title numbers for the next bullet point in the list and adds the `[bibliography]` role to the referenced page, if possible.
//end::how[]

//tag::prerequisits[]
* Only pages with the attribute `sectnums` are considered: set it per page or apply globally/per component
* All relevant pages are in the navigation tree
//end::prerequisits[]

//tag::configuration[]
The following table lists the supported attributes as well as their default values:

|===
|Attribute |Description |Default |Example

|numbered_titles
|De-/activates the automatic numbering of pages and sections in Antora for all pages where "sectnums" is set.
|false
|`numbered_titles: true`

.Using the "sequential numbering" extension feature
====
[source,yaml]
----

asciidoc:
  attributes:
    sectnums: ''
  extensions:
    - './antora_extensions/sectnumsoffset_antora.js'

antora:
  extensions:
    - require: './antora_extensions/asam-extension.js'
      numbered_titles: true
----
====

With this setting, all pages in Antora receive the attribute `sectnums` and are, therefore, automatically numbered.
