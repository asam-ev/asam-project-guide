//tag::context[]
Creates a subsection called "Related Topics" and filles it automatically with cross-references to (other) pages containing the listed keywords.
Works similar to the macro `reference` but adds said subsection.
//end::context[]

//tag::prerequisits[]
In order to work as intended, you must label all pages you want to automatically cross-reference with the attribute `:keywords:` followed by a comma-separated list of keywords for that page.

Keywords **MUST NOT** start with an exclamation mark!
//end::prerequisits[]

//tag:how[]
Add `related::<comma-separated-keywords>[]` in an empty line and replace `<comma-separated-keywords>` with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference.
You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword.
To negate a keyword, use an exclamationmark (`!`) in front of it.

.Using the `related` macro to include the keyword `hello` and exclude the keyword `world`
