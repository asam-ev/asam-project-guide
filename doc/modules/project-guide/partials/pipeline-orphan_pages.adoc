//tag::description[]
The ASAM Antora extension finds all pages not listed in any nav.adoc and puts a warning in the console output.
If configured, these pages can also automatically be listed under a separated navigation entry (e.g. "orphans") at the end of the Antora document.
//end::description[]

//tag::how[]
As long as the ASAM extension is defined in the Antora playbook (the "site.yml"), the console output warnings of this feature are active by default. +
However, to automatically list all found orphan pages in the navigation tree, at least the attribute "add_to_navigation" must be set to true.
//end::how[]

//tag::configuration[]
The following table lists the supported attributes as well as their default values:

|===
|Attribute |Description |Default |Example

|add_to_navigation
|De-/activates collecting and adding the orphan files under a new name in the navigation tree.
|false
|`add_to_navigation: true`

|unlisted_pages_heading
|Defines the name in the navigation tree under which the orphan pages are collected.
|"Unlisted Pages"
|`unlisted_pages_heading: Orphans`
