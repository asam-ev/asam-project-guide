//tag::description[]
Creates an automatically generated list with cross-references to (other) pages containing the listed keywords.
Works similar to the macro `related` but does not add a subsection.
//end::description[]

//tag::prerequisits[]
In order to work as intended, you must label all pages you want to automatically cross-reference with the attribute `:keywords:` followed by a comma-separated list of keywords for that page.

Keywords **MUST NOT** start with an exclamation mark!

//tag::how[]
Add `reference::<comma-separated-keywords>[]` in an empty line and replace `<comma-separated-keywords>` with a comma-separated list of keywords you want to reference.
You can exclude pages with certain other keywords by negating that keyword.
To negate a keyword, use an exclamationmark (`!`) in front of it.
