//tag::description[]
Since Asciidoctor counts all images and tables only within each page, their caption numbers start at 1 on every new Antora page by default.
In case of standards, these numbers must be sequential (and unique) within each standard, not each page.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the similarity in its topics, the Asciidoctor extension is also responsible for xref:project-guide:extensions/pipeline-sequential_sectnums.adoc[sequential section numbers and page titles].

//tag::how[]
The ASAM Antora extension, in combination with the sectnumsoffset_antora extension for Asciidoctor, creates sequential figure and table numbers in Antora. +
To use this feature, add `numbered_titles: true` to the Antora extension configuration.

The extension only considers images and tables if they are anchored with the correct anchor type (`[#fig-...]`, `[#tab-...]`).
See the xref:compendium:writing_guidelines/editorial_guide.adoc[] for detailed requirements on each anchor type.

//end::how[]

//tag::prerequisits[]
* All relevant figures must have an xref:compendium:writing_guidelines/editorial_guide.adoc[ASAM-type anchor]
* All relevant tables must have an xref:compendium:writing_guidelines/editorial_guide.adoc[ASAM-type anchor]
* All irrelevant figures and tables must not have a title
* All relevant pages are in the navigation tree
//end::prerequisits[]
