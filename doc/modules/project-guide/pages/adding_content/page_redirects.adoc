== Context
Sometimes, pages need to be moved or files renamed.
There are no restrictions on removing the file itself.
However, the xref macro cannot follow these changes automatically.
So, if a file is renamed (e.g. from "initial-file-name.adoc" to "new_file_name.adoc"), any cross reference to it will fail.
Similarly, if the file is deleted, the link will lead to a dead end.

To prevent the need for having to replace all links pointing to this file, a so-called "page alias" can be assigned to the changed page or (in case the page is deleted) to a dead end collection page.

== Result
References to the previous page name are redirected to the new target.

== Prerequisites
* The page has previously existed and has to be moved, renamed or deleted

== How
. Open the file that the cross references shall now point to.
. If not there yet, add the attribute "page-aliases" and add the old filename to it
.. If the file was moved to another module, also add the module
. If the original file was deleted, also remove it from the nav.adoc in the file's original module
