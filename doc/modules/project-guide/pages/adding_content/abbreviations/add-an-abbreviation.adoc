== Context
To make text shorter and easier to read, you can use abbreviations.
However, people new to __{asam}__ or a project may not know it and, therefore, might not understand the content.
For this reason, the page xref:compendium:abbreviations.adoc[] was created.

If a new abbreviation needs to be introduced, there are a few steps to be done.
This page lists them as well as things to look out for and some best practices.

== Result
A new abbreviation is added and the corresponding link attribute is set.

== Prerequisites
none

== How
. Open the **partial** "abbreviations.adoc" in the module "compendium"
. Add a new section at the alphabetically correct position for the abbreviation
. Add the description for the abbreviation in that section
. Add a link attribute at the top of the partial to the other link attributes with the following notation:
+
[source]
----
:<abbr>: {abb-link}<abbr_section>[<ABBR>]
----
+
, where `<abbr>` is the shorthand in lowercase, `<ABBR>` the shorthand in uppercase and `<abbr_section>` the section name (typically, this is the same as `<ABBR>`).
+
TIP: It is recommended to add the link attribute in its alphabetically correct position as well
