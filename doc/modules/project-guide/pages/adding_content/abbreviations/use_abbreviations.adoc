Abbreviations help keep text short.
In many cases, often used abbreviations may even enable people to understand things faster if they are familiar with the shorthand.

Since not everyone may know all abbreviations, however, a xref:compendium:abbreviations.adoc[page that has a summary of them] was introduced.
Here, you can find all abbreviations used throughout the Project Guide.

If you want to use an abbreviation on a page or partial, do the following:

. Make sure the page or partial contains the line `include::{abb}[]` above its body.
+
NOTE: If a page mostly consists of a partial for its body, make sure that at least one of the two contains this line.

. Ensure that the file or any includes **do not** contain the attribute `:is_abbreviations:` - this attribute marks the page where the full list of abbreviations is displayed!
. Add the link attribute for each abbreviation where you would like it to be.
You can find all available link attributes by looking in the **partial** "abbreviations.adoc" in the module "compendium"

== Recommendations
- Use the same abbreviation **only once per document**
- **Avoid using abbreviations in partials**, if it is a commonly used abbreviation
- **Highlight the abbreviation** with italic font (using two underscores "__" before and after the curly brackets)
