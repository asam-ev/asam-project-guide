== Context
A new module is a new core component of the Project Guide.
Each module is a distinct collection of content, targeted at providing information in an optimized way for the given target group.

Two types of modules exist:
* content hosts
* content aggregators

A *content host* is a module where (most) source content files lie.
Examples are the "tooling" module and the "compendium" modules. +
A *content aggregator* is a module where some header content is located, but the main information is included from another (host) module.
Examples are the "role-specific" and the "getting-involved" modules.

WARNING: Adding a new module adds to the overall structure of the Project Guide, thus making it more complex.
For this reason, adding a new module *should not* be taken lightly and must have a good reason for doing so.

== Result
A new module is added that contains the required base structure.

== Prerequisites
* It has been officially decided to add a new module to the Project Guide

== How
To add a new module to the Project Guide, follow these instructions:

. Copy the folder "reference-module-folder" located in the "examples" folder of the "project-guide" module with all its files and subfolders into the "modules" folder

. Rename the folder to be the name of the new module
+
TIP: The name of the folder will show in the page url.
Choose a meaningful but short name, if possible.

. Add a description for the module to the file "partials/module-description.adoc" in your new module

. Add the new module's nav.adoc file to the antora.yml in the "doc" folder
+
TIP: The position in the list reflects the order of the modules in Antora's sidebar.

. Change the content of the module's nav.adoc file according to the in-module-navigation you want to have in the sidebar.

. Add the module structure to the plantuml file "structure.puml" in the examles of the project-guide module
//TODO: Automate this process step!

. Update the xref:structure/content_structure.adoc[] file accordingly
