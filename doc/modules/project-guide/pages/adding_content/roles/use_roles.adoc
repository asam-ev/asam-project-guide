Most task and instruction pages in this Project Guide are assigned to one or more roles.
By assigning a role, the page is automatically linked to the corresponding role page(s), making it easier to find them for people of that role.
The benefit of these role labels is that

. they link to the role's main page (the user can click on the label) and
. they are automatically listed on that role page.

TIP: All available roles are defined in the file `site.yml` at root level of the repository.
If you need to define a new role first, see xref:adding_content/roles/add-new-role.adoc[].

In order to work with roles, just add the attribute of that role to that page:

. Add the attribute `{role-xyz}` to the page's body, where `xyz` is the name of the role (e.g. gtm).

IMPORTANT: The role only works correctly if added to a page.
Pages importing a partial with a role label will not show up correctly in the role's overview!

== Recommendations
- If the whole page relates to the role or roles, add the label right after the first empty line after the pages top includes, but before the first line of text.
- If only a section relates to a specific role, add that role after the section heading.
- If a page is relevant for multiple roles, add them in sequential lines (one role per line).
