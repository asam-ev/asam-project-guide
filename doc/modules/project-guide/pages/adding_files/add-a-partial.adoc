== Context
When content is to be reused on different pages, use a partial.
Partials are located in the partials folder (or a subfolder therein) of a module.

NOTE: Partials are not transformed into their own pages by themselves.
Rather, they only exist as html content when included in page.
If you need to have a page purely containing the content of a partial, create a page (see xref:adding_content/add-a-page.adoc) where the partial is included as the body.

See xref:adding_content/pages-vs-partials.adoc[] for more information on the difference between those two.

== Result
An Antora and ASAM conforming partial is created.

== Prerequisites
none

== How
IMPORTANT: These instructions already include the requirements of https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/partials/#create-a-partial-file[Creating A Partial File^] by Antora implicitely.
However, if one deviates from this guide here, the Antora restrictions and requirements still apply!

. Find the module you want your partial to be located in.
+
TIP: This should be the module which it relates to most closely.
See other partials and pages in the modules in question for reference.
You can also look at the xref:structure/content_structure.adoc[] for the Project Guide.

. Create your file in the "partials" folder or move it there
.. Alternatively, create a new folder and/or add your file to an existing folder within the "partials" folder if you want to add a structure within the module.
