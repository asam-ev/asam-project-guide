include::compendium:partial$abbreviations.adoc[]

== Context
In order to make documented tasks easier to understand, it is necessary to have a standard format for tasks in which they are written.
For this purpose, the _template-artifact-page.adoc file in this module's examples was created.
Each task that is documented in this Project Guide shall use the artifact template.

== Result
A task or artifact page is created that follows the ASAM artifact template.

== Prerequisites
none

== How
IMPORTANT: These instructions already include the requirements of https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.1/page/create-standard-page/[Creating A Standard Page] by Antora implicitely.
However, if one deviates from this guide here, the Antora restrictions and requirements still apply!

. Find the module you want your page to be located in.
+
TIP: This should be the module which it relates to most closely.
See other pages in the modules in question for reference.
You can also look at the xref:content-structure.adoc[] for the Project Guide.

. Create your file in the "pages" folder or move it there
.. Alternatively, create a new folder and/or add your file to an existing folder within the "pages" folder if you want to add a structure within the module.
+
TIP: You can copy the template file from the examples folder in the project-guide module folder.

. Add the following standard content to your file and modify it accordingly:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$reference-module-folder/pages/_template-artifact-page.adoc[]
----
+
NOTE: Remove the backslash in the template file before the include instruction when you copy the template file directly.
