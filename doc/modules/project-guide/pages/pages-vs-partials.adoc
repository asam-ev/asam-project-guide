== When To Use A Page
A page is located in the "pages" folder (or a subfolder therein) of a module.

Each page is rendered into an html by the Antora build pipeline and is accessible through direct link or (if set up) cross-references or the sidebar.

It can also be found using the search function.

* Pages **SHALL** be used for **content** that users shall be able to **search and access directly**.
* It **SHALL** also be used in case the content is supposed to have one or more **section headers**.
* **DO NOT** use **tags** in pages. Instead, use partials.
* Pages **MUST** contain a **title**.

For more information on page requirements, see xref:add-a-page.adoc[Adding A Page].

For more information on how Antora handles pages in general, see https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.1/page/#standard[Standard Pages In Antora].

== When To Use A Partial
A partial is located in the "partials" folder (or a subfolder therein) of a module.

Partials are not rendered into hmls by the Antora build pipeline.
Instead, they can be included in pages and only be rendered in those.

Partials also do not support all macros, particularly the ASAM macros are not applied.

* Partials **SHALL** be used for **reusable content** that is included in **at least two separate files**.
* Partials **MAY** be sectioned with **tags**.
* **DO NOT** use a **title** or **section headings** in partials.


For more information on partials requirements, see xref:add-a-partial.adoc[Adding A Partial].

For more information on how Antora handles partials in general, see https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.1/page/#partial[Reusable Partial Pages In Antora].
