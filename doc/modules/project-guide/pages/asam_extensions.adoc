Antora and Asciidoctor already provide a rich set of features and macros.
However, not all functions that __{asam}__ requires for an efficient and partially automated content structuring are present by default.
For this reason, an Antora extension and an Asciidoctor extension were created.

This page collects all the features of this extension, such as the custom macros, and explains what they do and how to use them.
Each macro also has a detailed instructions page with more details.

TIP: For more information on how to write an Antora extension, see https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/extend/extensions/[the official extension guide] and check out the relevant https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/tree/main/packages[package repositories], particularly their `devdocs` folders.

The source repository of the ASAM extensions is https://code.asam.net/common/asam-antora-extensions.


== Added features
The ASAM Antora extension adds the following features to Antora:

* Support for the <<ASAM Antora macros>>
* Identifying and (optional) listing <<Orphan pages>>
* Creating a <<Keyword-overview page>>
* Sequential <<Page numbering,page and section numbers>> in Antora

NOTE: All following examples assume the extension is located under "./antora_extensions", where "." is the location of the "site.yml" file (the https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/playbook/[Antora playbook^]).


== General configuration
The following table describes general configuration on using the extension:

|===
|Attribute |Description |Default |Example

|id
|Defines an id by which the extension can be specifically called from the CLI.
|none
|`id: asam-extension`

|enabled
|De-/activates this extension by default.
If deactivated, the extension must be explicitely called from the CLI.
Only relevant in combination with `id`.
|true
|`enabled: false`
