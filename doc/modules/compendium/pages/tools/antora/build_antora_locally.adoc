== Context
This guide explains how to build this Project Guide locally on your PC without having activated the ASAM build pipeline.
The suggested method is to use the provided docker-compose.yml in this repository.

== Result
The Project Guide is built locally and the content can be accessed from the "site" folder.

== Prerequisites
* {docker-icon-norole} {docker-url}[Docker^] shall be installed and running.
* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python^] shall be installed (during installation, check the box "Add Python [version] to PATH").
* All browser or file explorer windows shall be closed. Errors may occur when overwriting existing files.


== How
. In a {powershell}, open the _ASAM Project Guide_ repository.
. Pull the current version of the repository: `git pull`
. Check out the branch you want to build (default: use the _master_ branch): `git checkout <branch name>`
. [[only-required-once]]Only required once:
+
--
** Make sure that the folder with _docker-compose.yml_ is active.
** Run the following build process: `docker-compose build antora`
--
+
. Run the _scripts/build.py_ Python script: `python scripts/build.py`
+
-> The generated page automatically opens in the browser (Chrome).


== Troubleshooting / Known Issues
=== The python script does not execute all the steps
The script must be executed from the correct folder.

. Navigate to the folder where the script is located.
. Open a {powershell} window
. Execute 'python build.py'

=== I don't want to/cannot use python
Unfortunately, there are some features that will not be available without python (i.e. the custom macros and summary features).
If you cannot use python for whatever reason, you may use a python docker container and run everything from within there.

=== The Antora generator does not work anymore
If you had already set up the Antora image with the one-time step `docker-compose build antora` before and it stopped working, there is a chance that some technical changes have been made.
To switch to the newest setup,

. run 'docker-compose down' to stop any currently running docker-compose,
. delete the image related to the project-guide antora setup (e.g. "asam-project-guide_antora") with the `docker rmi` command (see `docker rmi --help` for more information) +
+
NOTE: You might need to force the deletion!

. prune the volume used by antora
. re-do the "<<only-required-once,only required once>>" steps

=== I changed my content but I do not see it in Antora
Any program that blocks the site folder will stop Antora from generating the new pages.
The reason is that it needs to delete the existing folder first before the new content is then written into it.
Make sure that no program is currently accessing and blocking files or folders from the "./site" path.
Tools that are unproblematic:

* Windows Explorer
* Google Chrome
