WSL is short for Windows Subsystem for Linux.
From link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about[ window=_blank]:

> The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

In the context of Docker, WSL2 and a compatible Linux distribution are used to run containers built for Linux on a Windows computer.
In other words, WSL allows you to run a Linux directly within Windows without having to install a new operating system in parallel to your main one (Windows).
