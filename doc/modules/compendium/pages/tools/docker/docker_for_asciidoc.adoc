== Using docker for asciidoc

The xref:{vscode-extensions}#_asciidoc[VSCode extension for Asciidoc] provides a decent preview.
However, some styling and content will not look exactly as in the final result.
If the layout and final look is important, you should create the HTMl output from the adoc files by using the asciidoctor docker container (configured in the xref:compendium:tools/docker/standard_docker_config.adoc[standard docker-compose.yml]).

For information on how to execute docker-compose, see the xref:tooling:docker.adoc[].

IMPORTANT: Make sure to execute the asciidoctor service in the container as it may contain more than one service.

After running docker-compose, one or more html files will have been created depending on your docker-compose.yml.
If you use the standard configuration, the created file will be named "HTML_standard_local_build.html" and can be found in the same folder as your "docker-compose.yml" file.

TIP: For ensuring compliance with the ASAM style guidelines, make sure the project contains the relevant https://code.asam.net/common/style-resources[style resources^] and that they are included as "preamble.adoc" in the file you are processing with asciidoctor.
