NOTE: This works if the container was already created through either using the <<Running Docker-Compose From VSCode,VSCode method>> or the <<Running Docker-Compose From Powershell,Powershell method>>.

. Open Docker Desktop (if you already started it, it may be in the system tray)
. Go to "Containers/Apps" and select your container from the list
. Click the image:compendium:play-button-docker.png[alt=Play] button to run the container
