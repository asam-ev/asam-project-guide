== Why use Docker?

TIP: You can download the standard docker-compose.yml link:{docker-compose-download}[here,opts=download].

NOTE: For Antora, the docker-compose is slightly different.
You can see an example in the {guide-repo-url}[Project Guide repository].

// TODO: Add description and specifications for Antora file.

== Standard docker-Compose Instructions

. Create a new `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of the project.
. Add the following content to the created file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::{docker-compose-include}[]

----
+
. Run docker-compose with `docker-compose run asciidoctor`

NOTE: Usually, the only adaption that may be required is to change the input file (`standard/main.adoc`).All the other configuration required is in the docker-compose.yml.

TIP: It is also possible to include the running of scripts into this (e.g. adoc2LOFT)


=== Typical configuration Options

Each project may have slightly different requirements, and at different stages of the project different features are available or not.
To accommodate for that, the docker-compose.yml can be configured with options in the `entrypoint`.


=== Asciidoctor diagram

If Asciidoctor Diagram is to be used, make sure that the option `-r asciidoctor-diagram` is set.


=== Mathjax

Mathjax is a JavaScript display engine intended for displaying mathmatical expressions in browsers.
This can be activated by adding `-a mathjax` to the entrypoint.


=== Asciidoctor bibtex

If Asciidoctor Bibtex is to be used, make sure that the option `-r asciidoctor-bibtex` is set.

NOTE: The use of asciidoctor-bibtex requires that a bibtex configuration for the project is present.
If the project does not have such a configuration (yet), remove this option.
Otherwise, the container will fail to create any output!


=== Single input File

You can define the input file by using `path-to-file/filename.format`.
In the standard version above, this is set to `standard/main.adoc`.
Replace this, if necessary.


=== Multiple input Files

If you want to process more than one file in one go, you can replace `path-to-file`, `filename` or both with `*`, so that it searches through all paths, files or both respectively.


=== Output file

You can define the output file by using `-o path-to-file/filename.format`.
By default, HTML is created, so use ".html" as your format.
In the standard version above, this is set to `HTML_standard_local_build.html`.


=== Output path

If you only want to specifiy the output path but leave the naming convention of the input files, use the option `-D path` instead of
