The Activity Bar contains a direct access to many important base or extensions features.
The following image shows standard functionality, but some extensions like GitLens will add their own icon and features.

// Explorer - shows all of the files and folders you have access to
// Search – Find and replace in files
// Git – all git related commands, only active if in a git repository
// Extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.
