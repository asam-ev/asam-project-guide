Visual Studio Code can be adapted to each project's and the user's needs.
This is done by installing and using extensions.
This section shows how to install a new extension from the marketplace.
As an example, we will use the xref:{vscode-extensions}#_asciidoc[AsciiDoc] extension.

The AsciiDoc extension for {vscode} allows for easy creation and supported editing of AsciiDoc or adoc files within {vscode}.
For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension.
You can access that documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace.

. Access the extensions window through the {vscode} menu bar -> View -> Extensions.
