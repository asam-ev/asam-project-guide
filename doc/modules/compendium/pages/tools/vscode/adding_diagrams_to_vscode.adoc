:keywords: vscode,kroki,diagrams

include::compendium:partial$_attributes.adoc[]

The kroki extension supports a wide range of diagrams from BPMN to Graphviz to PlantUML and Vega graphs using kroki and asciidoctor-kroki.

You can see the full range and examples on the official https://kroki.io/examples.html[website^].

include::partial$vscode/kroki.adoc[]

== Caching diagrams locally

NOTE: This is a per-file setting and must be done in each applicable AsciiDoc file.

By default, diagrams are not saved locally.
To cache and save diagrams locally, set the kroki-fetch-diagram attribute in your document header:

    = My amazing document
    :kroki-fetch-diagram:

This will store images by default in your document folder.
However, you may also set `imagesdir` to store them elsewhere:

    = My amazing document
    :kroki-fetch-diagram:
    :imagesdir: images


NOTE: In the example above, the images are now stored in a folder named "images".

The images are served over http:// and you must allow your preview to include data from unsafe sources.
To do this:

. Open the xref:compendium:tools/vscode//vscode_command-palette.adoc[].
. Enter ``asciidoc preview security`` .
. Choose ``Allow insecure content``.

NOTE: Access to this global setting is only available if you have currently are in an AsciiDoc file in {vscode}.
Otherwise, the setting will not show up.

== Testing kroki examples

With the settings done and caching activated, you can test Kroki with the following examples:
