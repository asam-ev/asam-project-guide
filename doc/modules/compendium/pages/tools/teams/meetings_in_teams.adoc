== Context
Virtual meetings can be created directly from MS Teams.
Meetings that are sent to a channel or created directly within that channel let everyone who has access to that channel join.
If you want to restrict the access, create a meeting outside of a channel and invite users selectively.

== Result
* A virtual meeting with teams communication is created
* Only the intended users have access to the created meeting

== Prerequisites
* User has access to the Teams channel
* User has full MS Teams license

== How
