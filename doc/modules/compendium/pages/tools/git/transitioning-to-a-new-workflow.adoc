This describes the transition of Open Scenario 2.0 to the new workflow.

IMPORTANT: This phase will run up to the upcoming project meeting on 4th to 6th of May

== Repository tidy up

*Who: all project members*

*	Remove stale branches (old branches that are not active or relevant) - merge them or delete them
*	Close and consolidate issues –review the issues and see if they are all still relevant/needed.
Close those that aren’t
*	Consolidate branches that are maybe too granular – Merge them into one

== Feature list compilation

*Who: WG Leads*

. Compile a list of the features planned for implementation by each of the working groups.
This should include a first estimate of the delivery date for a first draft.
This is based off of the table shared by Gil on 23.04:

+
.The headers for the table of features
[%headers,cols='6*']
|===
h|Feature |Details & Dependencies |Maturity / Readiness |Must be in 2.0? |Expected Delivery Date | Comments

|Feature xx

|
|
|

|===

. Issues created -> 1to1 mapping to planned deliveries (e.g. feature in feature list of document  subsection)
. Define a delivery date
. Assign a responsible user
. Assign label `Deliverable`

*Next Stage:*

. All WG leads define a set of milestones, assign issues to milestones

== Branch structure setup
*Who: ASAM Office*

. Create the develop branch and set it to default
. Setup the release branch
. Add draft flags to all content
. Add draft attribute and config to CI
