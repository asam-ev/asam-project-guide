Git:: A version control system.
Used by {asam} in their projects.

GitLab:: Popular Open Source platform {asam} uses that leverages Git.

Remote:: The server, i.e. not on your PC, often used to refer to the master repository of a project on a server.
The default name on (local) git is "origin".

Local:: A locally (on your pc) stored (cloned) version of the remote repository.

Working Copy:: Files that are not yet handled by git or that contain changes git is not "aware" of.

Staging Area:: Collection of files or changes that git is aware of but that are not yet part of the history.

Merge Request:: If the changes made in a separate branch of a project are to be combined with another branch (usually the main or master branch), a Merge Request is triggered to review the changes and solve any conflicts where two independently made changes on the same file would interfere with one another.
