TIP: It is best practice to check for changes on remote before changing files locally and before pushing changes to remote.

The Git workflow for making changes is a 3 step process:

.Git Worklfow

. Add files from the working copy to the staging area.
. Commit staged files to your local repo.
. Push to a remote repository.
