== Merge commit Strategy
- History of commits in a PR must be clean prior to merge
- Commit messages to a protected or master branch must adhere to conventional commits specification

Repositories allow fast-forward merges only (`--ff-only`) and squash commits by default.
This means we do not have a merge commit and that all commits are squashed.

For squash commits with one commit, the commit message is taken directly (squash does not take place).
For actual squashes the commit messages are taken from:

. The first multi-line commit message in the merge.
. The merge requestâ€™s title if no multi-line commit message is found.

Squash commits is enabled by default but can be turned off, we do not always want to squash.
This is to make sure that for those times that people create multiple unrelated changes in one branch we can still add them to the history.


== Merge/Pull Request Review

A{Pull Request opened} --> B(Initial review by CCB)

C --> D(Final CCB review & merge)
----

. Pull/Merge request opened
* Technical discussion in comments
. Initial review by CCB, includes technical alignment with other activities in and outside of the project
. When a PR is ready for a review the CCB assigns it to a reviewer(s)
* This could be a group in an ASAM project, an expert in the CCB or a participating service provider (e.g. for editorial review)
* On approval by the reviewers the PR/MR is assigned the ~ReadyForCCBReview label
. Final review & merge by CCB - includes ensuring clear commit history that adheres to xref:git/Commit-Guidelines.adoc[Commit Guidelines]
* Discussion highlights and final decisions need to be documented in PRs/issues
* If necessary, further participants will be invited to CCB for more discussion (e.g. if a decision is needed on a PR or issue)


NOTE: Discussion and feedback takes place via comments in the PR


=== Change management

. Auto-generated changelog included in release based on *correctly* formatted commits
. Manual summary included in spec - overview of important changes in the new version

=== Milestone management
* For now - milestones as defined in the proposal roadmap - this might be subject to change as the project develops
* PRs to be assigned to a milestone by PR creator
* CCB to review the milestone assignment
* This must relate the change type (breaking change, backwards compatible, bug) to the release types (major/minor/maintenance)
* For now, we will work with one master.
Should we have many PRs targeting a future release we might implement multiple "development" branches for the different versions.
(Only when necessary)
