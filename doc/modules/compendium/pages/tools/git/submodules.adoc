== What are submodules
Submodules are a way to include other repositories within your repository.
This way, you do not need to copy identical content from another repository and risk getting out of synch with changes in said external repository.
Simplified, a submodule is a pointer to another repository in a specific (!) version.
This pointer is part of the repository. +
For further information, see the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[official documentation].

This page give an overview over how to handle submodules in ASAM projects.

TIP: If you are not setting up or responsible for a git repository, you only need to know how to xref:compendium:tools/git/submodules/submodule-pull.adoc[pull a previously set up submodule in git].
For this you only need to know: `+git submodule update --init+`. See below for details.

== Git submodule usage

ASAM uses submodules to include reusable resources in all repositories, e.g. document style configuration.
The submodule has to be added to the repository during setup of the repository.
