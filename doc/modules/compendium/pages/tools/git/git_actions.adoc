Add:: Will add new and changed files to the Staging Area.

Commit:: Save the state of a repository (ideally with a "commit message" that gives some background).

It applies the staging area or, if used with the command '-a', all changes, staged or unstaged.

Push:: Copy the committed changes to the remote.

Pull:: Update your local copy with all changes that have been made to the remote.

Branch:: Diverge from the main line of development by creating a branch; this has a pointer to a specific commit in the parent to make it clear where it started.

Most times, this is used to integrate the changes from your branch to the main (master) branch.
