Creating a fork "clones" the repository into your profile, allowing you to make changes without having to interact with the main repository.

TIP: The procedure is the same on code.asam.net (gitlab) and on github.

== Forking step-by-Step

. Select "Fork" from the top of the repository page
. Select yourself from the list of users
. Wait for the forking process to finish

Once you see your name in the url of the repository, the forking is complete.

== Creating A Pull Request From A Fork

To submit the changes you make in your fork back to the original repository, submit a Merge/Pull request as normal in the main repository, making sure to select your fork.
