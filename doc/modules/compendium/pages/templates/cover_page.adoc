The official name is used for classification and is also used qualitatively in the portfolio and the Standards Collection (SVN), and on the https://www.asam.net/[ASAM website^].
The official name typically be-gins with __{asam}__, and the actual name of the standard.
The standard name matches the subarea used in the logical structure of the SVN and the ASAM website.

The market name can also be added in round parentheses.
The descriptive title typically explains the abbreviations used in the official name.

The descriptive title is identical for all the standards of a (sub)area.
There is a base standard and 0 to N associated standards for each subarea.
A standard can itself consist of several parts.
It is subdivided to indicate which independent documents belong together within the standard.

The name of a part or the name of the associated standard is used as the document name.

The version always relates to the current document and not to the standard designation in the descriptive title.
This means that all the parts of a standard and all associated standards can have their own versions.

The ASAM portfolio lists only the base standards and the associated standards, but not independent parts. +
Technical specifications in the base standard use the document name "Programmers' Guide", and documents describing an __{api}__ that is available as a model use the document name "Programmers' Reference Guide". +
Technology references form parts and are not associated standards, but the portfolio does name them separately as available add-ons.

The footer always contains official name, descriptive title and version.
The relationship to the document name can be indicated only by the market name stated in parentheses after the official name.
