== Issue resolution
//tag::issue_resolution[]
The Technical Steering Committee ({tsc}) remains the ultimate authority for making the final release decision.
Once a new revision of the standard is ready and got the technical release from the Standard Expert Group, the Standard Manager submits the standard to the TSC.
The Release Process is carried out, as described in chapter 1.4 "Release Phase".
