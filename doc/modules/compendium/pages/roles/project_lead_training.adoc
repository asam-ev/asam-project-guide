== Meeting moderation best practices


=== Before a meeting
* Moderator must be neutral
** Allow all opinions. Hold back own opinion and proposals. Drive consensus building​ independent of own position. Accept the majority.​
** Do not be judgmental. Let the group be judgmental:
+
[cols="3,1,5",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
|Yes ​ | |No  

|"That is excellent!" |-> |"What do the others think about it?  
|"That is nonsense!"​     |-> |      "Does anyone has objections about that proposal?"  
|"Let's do this!"​        |-> |     "Should we do this?"  
|===

** Moderator can voice his opinion and make own proposals
*** Moderator must still remain neutral when managing the meeting. Give other opinions and proposals the same attention than yours.​
*** Moderator should send a second employee, who can openly represent the company's opinion and proposals. Moderator must treat him like everyone else.​
* Moderator must have technical competence in the standard's subject matter
* In case the number of people that come to meetings drop
** A small decline in participation is normal and shall be accepted.
** If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here.
** Remind people about their man-day commitments, too.


=== During a meeting
* Keep the discussion focused on topic  
** Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic
** But let the discussion go for a while
** Drive discussion towars results/decisions
   (not towards own/right results/decisions)
* Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution
* Do not let the discussion become repetitive
* In case discussions are very controversial
** Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has​ been said, carry out a vote.
** If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something "might not work" or​ "could be too slow"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known.
** If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g.
*** propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone  ​
*** carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​
*** propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort)  
** Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority.
** Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority.
* In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down
** Ask a member or the service provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic.
** In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on.
** Moderator takes the initiative and drives the discussion forward with his own proposals. This is typically a situation, where the moderator can give up neutrality a bit without doing damage to the meeting culture.


=== At the end of a meeting
* Give a summary of what has been said. Propose a conclusion/decision
* Obtain consensus of the conclusion/decision
* Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo
* Carry out a vote if needed
* Document key-points of the discussion (in a projected memo TODO)
