== Meeting moderation best practices
- Moderator must be neutral
 - Allow all opinions. Hold back own opinion and proposals. Drive consensus building​ independent of own position. Accept the majority.​
 - Do not be judgmental​            Let the groupe be judgmental  
 > "That is excellent!"​    ->      "What do the others think about it?  
 > "That is nonsense!"​     ->      "Does anyone has objections about that proposal?"  
 > "Let's do this!"​        ->      "Should we do this?"  
 - Moderator can voice his opinion and make own proposals
  - Moderator must still remain neutral when managing the meeting. Give other opinions and proposals the same attention than yours.​  
  - Moderator should send a second employee, who can openly represent the company's opinion and proposals. Moderator must treat him like everyone else.​
- Moderator must have technical competence in the standard#s subject matter
- Keep the discussion focused on topic  
 - Point out to the panelists that they are off-topic
 - But let the discussion go for a while
 - Drive discussion towars results/decisions
   (not towards own/right results/decisions)
- Ask less involved people about their opinion/contribution
- Do not let the discussion become repetitive
- In case discussions are very controversial
 - Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo. Once everything has​ been said, carry out a vote.
 - If opposing positions are based upon uncertainty (e.g. something "might not work" or​ "could be too slow"), then propose an investigation and postpone the discussion until​ the results are known.
 - If opposing positions are based upon different status-quo in member companies (e.g. something is implemented one way in company A and the other way in company B), try to find a compromise, e.g.
 > propose a mix of both approaches, which allows easy migration for everyone  ​
 > carry out an advantage/disadvantage comparison with all group members and then let them vote​  
 > propose to include both approaches in the standard (as a last resort)  
 - Resolution of controversial topics requires a good feeling for the situation, creativity and technical competence to propose solutions. The key is to propose a resolution process or a solution that is acceptable for the majority.
 - Frequently, controversial discussions are between a few group members, only. In this case, reduce the talk time of the opponents by re-activating the less involved group members. Ask them about their position or alternative proposals. There is a good chance that a neutral member has a proposal, which leads to a resolution that is acceptable by the majority.
- In case the discussion and motivation to work on a topic dies down
 - Ask a member or the service provider to create a proposal, concept or chapter-draft​ for the next meeting. Then postpone and move on to next topic.
 - In case group members have a lack of knowledge: propose to invite an expert at the next​ meeting. Postpone and move on.
 - Moderator takes the initiative and drives the discussion forward with his own proposals. This is typically a situation, where the moderator can give up neutrality a bit without doing damage to the meeting culture.
- In case the number of people that come to meetings drop
 - A small decline in participation is normal and shall be accepted.
 - If the number drops significantly, openly talk about meeting efficiency and meeting style, and what can be improved. Typically, the reasons for low participation lies here.
 - Remind people about their man-day commitments, too.
- Give a summary of what has been said. Propose a conclusion/decision
- Obtain consensus of the conclusion/decision
- Clearly document the opposing positions in the memo
- Carry out a vote if needed
- Document key-points of the discussion (in a projected memo TODO)
