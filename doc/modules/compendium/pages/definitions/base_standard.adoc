A base standard defines the syntax, abstract models, and functionality for general use.
A base standard is defined in a technology-independent form.
It can use a problem-/task-related notation, e.g., UML for an object model, or any suitable description for protocols.
Typically, a base standard is

* A xref:compendium:definitions/format_description.adoc[] (data structure) **or**
* A xref:compendium:definitions/protocol_definition.adoc[] **or**
* An {api}

and has the following properties:

* Platform-independent
* Technology-independent
* Supplier-independent
* Does not contradict any other https://www.asam.net/standards/[ASAM standard^]

There are platform- and technology-specific mapping rules for each base standard.
These are defined in xref:compendium:definitions/technology_reference.adoc[] as independent parts of the base standard.
