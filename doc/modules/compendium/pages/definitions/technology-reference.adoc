A technology reference specifies the technology-dependent interpretation of the generic standard as mapping rules.
If these mapping rules are complied with, the deliverables are technology-specific implementations of standards that are suitable for a specific implemen-tation platform and native programming languages.
These technology references are typically available for base standards and companion standards.
