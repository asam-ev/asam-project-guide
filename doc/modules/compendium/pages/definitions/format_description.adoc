A format description standard defines the syntax and semantics of a file format to exchange data.
Currently these standards are defined in XML, but older standards, such as ASAM MCD-2 MC (ASAP2), still use proprietary ASCII formats.
There are also binary description standards, for example, to store measurement data efficiently.
