== Project-Specific Labels

=== Milestones

> These are actually not labels but defined separately in the milestones section of the project (under issues)


=== Group/Category labels 

All ASAM projects have their Work Packages for projects clustered into groups or categories. These labels are defined individually for each project and should be used to categorise issues. 
 
=== Work Package Labels
All ASAM projects are have work items assigned to smaller work packages (that are then also assigned to a group or category). These labels are defined individually for each project and should be used to further categorise issues.

> An issue can have multiple Group and Work Package labels provided that it is relevant to more than one of these.
