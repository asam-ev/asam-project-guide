NOTE: This page covers how to submit candidacy for the role of xref:role-specific:project-lead.adoc[Project Lead]. +
If you want to learn more about the role of the Project Lead and its requirements, see xref:getting-involved:signing_up/become_project_lead.adoc[].


== Context
Every project at ASAM needs a Project Lead.
Consequently, a project may only move from Proposal phase to Standard Development phase if a Project Lead has been elected/designated. +
In most cases, the Idea Giver is the one elected Project Lead, but this is not a requirement.

== Result
You have submitted your candidacy for the role of Project Lead.


== Prerequisites
* You must be a project member


== How
TODO


== What Happens Next
The Project Lead is officially decided at the beginning of the project, if the Proposal has been approved by the TSC.
If there is more than one candidate, the project will then decide on the Project Lead.
Otherwise, the single candidate is just confirmed formally by the project.
