When organizing a face-to-face proposal workshop, a meeting room needs to be reserved depending on the amount of people.
The following options are available at the ASAM office:

[cols="4,3,3"]

|Room           | max Pax without Corona    | max Pax with Corona

|Meeting Room

| 12

|Audimax

|Saal

With the duration of at least 1 day, catering is needed as well.
All of this can be organized by the {gtm}.

=== Online workshop

|===
h|Duration
| 2 - 4 hours

h|Location
| Microsoft Teams
|===

Due to the fact that online meetings are more straining than face-to-face meetings, experience shows that proposal workshops need to be streamlined to reduce the duration to a maximum of 4 hours.
