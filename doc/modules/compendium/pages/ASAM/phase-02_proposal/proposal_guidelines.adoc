== Content Definition
To write a proposal document, its content shall be defined in a way that every participant can contribute and give feedback. +
Participants gather content for sections in issues in the proposal repository and discuss them there.
The results can then be transferred to the target document in AsciiDoc form.


=== Gather Topics In Issues
{recommended}

Use issues to collect topics and tasks for the proposal writing. +
If this is an evolution of an existing ASAM standard, consider collecting and using backlog issues from the previous project first.

The name of the issue shall correspond to the respective section.

=== Use Issue Templates
{mandatory}

When working with issues, use the provided issue templates in the proposal repository.
Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where.

=== Label Issues Correctly
{mandatory}

When working with issues, make sure that each issues related to the proposal phase contains the label `Proposal`.
This helps with separating issues from the proposal phase later when transferring content to the standardization repository.

NOTE: If you use the <<Use issue templates,issue templates>> provided in the proposal repository, the label may be automatically assigned already.
