== Context

The first major event in the xref:getting-involved:proposal_phase.adoc#_the_proposal_phase[Proposal phase] is the Proposal Workshop.
Here, the project idea is presented to a broader audience for the first time and discussed.

The Idea Giver needs to prepare the event for it to be efficient and effective.
ASAM provides a standard xref:compendium:ASAM/phase-02_proposal/proposal_workshop_gameplan.adoc[**Proposal Workshop Gameplan**] to help with the preparation.
