NOTE: This page covers how to set up a proposal workshop.
If you are interested in joining a listed workshop, check out xref:getting-involved:proposal/04_join_proposal_workshop.adoc[] instead.

== Context

The first major event in the xref:getting-involved:proposal_phase.adoc#_the_proposal_phase[Proposal phase] is the Proposal Workshop.
Here, the project idea is presented to a broader audience for the first time and discussed.

The Idea Giver needs to prepare the event for it to be efficient and effective.
ASAM provides a standard xref:compendium:ASAM/proposal_phase/proposal_workshop_gameplan.adoc[Proposal Workshop Gameplan] to help with the preparation.
