== Developer certification of origin (DCO)
To make a good faith effort to ensure licensing criteria are met, ASAM open source projects require the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process to be followed.

The {dco} is an attestation attached to every contribution made by every developer.
In the commit message of the contribution, (described more fully later in this document), the developer simply adds a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the {dco}.

When a developer submits a patch, it is a commitment that the contributor has the right to submit the patch per the standard license.
The DCO agreement is shown below and online.

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
        have the right to submit it under the open source license
        indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
        best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
        source license and I have the right under that license to
        submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
        or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
        I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
        Indicated in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
        it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
        are public and that a record of the contribution (including
        all personal information I submit with it, including my
        sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
        consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
        involved.

== DCO sign-Off Methods
The {dco} requires a sign-off message in the following format appear on each commit in the pull request:
[source]
----
Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname <email@address.com>
----

The {dco} text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either `-s` or `--signoff` to your usual Git commit commands.
If you forget to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit with the sign-off by running `git commit --amend -s`.
You can add sign-offs to multiple commits (including commits originally authored by others, if you are authorized to do so) using `git rebase --signoff`.
If you’ve pushed your changes to GitHub already you’ll need to force push your branch after this with `git push --force-with-lease`.

If you want to be reminded to add the sign-off for commits in your repository, you can add the following commit-message git hook to your repository:

[source,shell]
----
    #!/bin/sh
    #
    = Check for dCO/Signed-off-by in message
    #

    if ! grep -q "^Signed-off-by: " "$1"
    then
    echo "Aborting commit: Commit message is not signed off" >&2
    exit 1
    fi
----

Placing this script into a file called `.git/hooks/commit-msg` and making it executable (e.g. using `chmod a+x .git/hooks/commit-msg` on unixoid operating systems) will prevent commits that do not have a sign-off.
