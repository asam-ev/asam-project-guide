[.lead]
All ASAM OpenX Standards are written using the Asciidoc format https://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc Homepage^].
AsciiDoc is a mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.


You write an AsciiDoc document the same way you would write a normal text document.
There are no markup tags or weird format notations.
AsciiDoc files are designed to be viewed, edited and printed directly or translated to other presentation formats.

**Main advantages:**

* Can be edited in any text editor or using the online editor in GitLab
* Focus on content not on formatting!
* Versionable and diffable â€“ i.e. we can tell who did what, when and where!
* In the end we can deliver an interactive html instead of a static pdf


The content of this page is intended to provide a quick overview of the most-used features of the language.
See the links below for more detail

== Headings


[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
= Page title
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section
===== Level 4 section
....
|
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section
===== Level 4 section
|===

You can have only one page title, but you can have multiple section titles.
For example, you might have three level 1 sections that include level 2 and 3 sections:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
= Page title
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section

== Level 1 section

== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section
....
|
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
== Level 1 section
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section
|===


== Bold text

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
*Text*
....
| *Text*
|===

== Italic text

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
_Text_
....
|_Text_
|===

== Bulleted lists
[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
* Item 1
* Item 2
** Item 2a
+
Continuation text for the previous list item.

* Item 3
....
|* Item 1

* Item 2
** Item 2a
+
Continuation text for the previous list item.

* Item 3
|===
TIP: The + is a list continuation.
It keeps the text inline with the list item.
Omitting the + affects the formatting of that line.

Adding another space before the + adopts the indentation of one level higher:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
* Item 1
* Item 2
** Item 2a

+
Continuation text for the previous list item.
* Item 3
....
|
* Item 1
* Item 2
** Item 2a

+
Continuation text for the previous list item.
* Item 3
|===

== Labeled lists

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2
....
|Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2

|

....
[horizontal]
Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2
....
|[horizontal]
Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2
|===

When you add [horizontal] above item 1, the label and description appear on the same line.
That works well when you have very short descriptions.


== Ordered lists


[cols="a,a"]
|===

|
....
. number
.. loweralpha
... lowerroman
. number
....
|
. number
.. loweralpha
... lowerroman
. number

|
We can mix ordered and bulleted lists however we want:

....
* bullet
. number
** bullet
.. loweralpha
....
|
* bullet
. number
** bullet
.. loweralpha

|===


== Images

....
image::file.gif[alt text]
....

TIP: "alt text" means alternative text.
It describes the image that appears on the page.
The primary use is for visually-impaired users who use screen readers.

The image path is obtained by combining the root of the project directory, followed by the imagesdir parameter defined in the preamble, followed by whatever you define in image.
So if it is defined as
....
:imagesdir: images
....
and we have
....
image::subdirectory/filename.png[]
....
Then the full search path is
....
{projectroot}/images/subdirectory/filename.png
....


=== Images with links

You can add a link to an image so it acts like a "button."


*Syntax*

Use one of the following syntax when adding your image:

....
image:<file_name>.<ext>[alt=<text>,link=<url>,window=_blank]
xref:path-to-file/file.adoc[image:<file_name>.<ext>[alt=<text>]<Link name>^]
<url>[image:<file_name>.<ext>[alt=<text>]<Link name>^]
....

"window=_blank" opens the link in a new browser tab (or window).
The addition of "^" at the end of the link name does the same in a shorthand version.

For example:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
image:logo.png[alt=A button titled ASAM Home,link=https://asam.net,window=_blank]
....
|
image:logo.png[alt=A button titled ASAM Home,link=https://asam.net,window=_blank]
|===




== Videos

Hosted on YouTube:

....
video::id[youtube]
....

Hosted locally in GitLab:

....
video::file.mp4
....

== Links

The syntax that you should use depends on what you're linking to:

* <<Link to an external site>>
* <<Link to a section on the same page>>
* <<Link to another page in the docs>>

=== Link to an external site

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
https://www.url.com[link text^]
....
|https://www.url.com[link text^]
|===

The ^ opens the link in a new browser tab.

=== Link to a section on the same page

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
<<section_title>>
....

e.g.
....
For more details, see <<Headings>>.
....
|

For more details, see <<Headings>>.
|
The link text can be something other than the section title:

....
<<section_title,Different link text>>
....

e.g.

....
<<Headings,Learn the syntax for headings>>
....
|

<<Headings,Learn the syntax for headings>>.
|===

You can create custom anchors and link to them as well

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
I want an anchor [[anchorlabel]]

Then I make a <<anchorlabel, link>> to it
....
|

I want an anchor [[anchorlabel]]

Then I make a <<anchorlabel, link>> to it
|===

=== Link to another page in the docs

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
....
xref:writing_guidelines/AsciiDoc-Guide.adoc[link text for inline macro]
xref::writing_guidelines/AsciiDoc-Guide.adoc[link text for macro]
....
|xref:writing_guidelines/AsciiDoc-Guide.adoc[link text for inline macro]
xref::writing_guidelines/AsciiDoc-Guide.adoc[link text for macro]
|===

TIP: Use the inline macro when you add text before and/or after the macro.
Otherwise, use the standard macro.

== Admonitions: Notes, tips, etc.

You might want to draw attention to certain statements by creating notes or tips - so-called admonitions.
Format them as follows:

....
NOTE: text

TIP: text

IMPORTANT: text

CAUTION: text

WARNING: text
....

If your admonition is longer, use the extended form:

....
[NOTE]
====
text
====

[TIP]
====
text
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
text
====

[CAUTION]
====
text
====

[WARNING]
====
text
====
....




Use each of these sparingly.
You don't want to create pages that are full of notes and tips.
They become less meaningful if you do.

Here's what each of these looks like when the AsciiDoc content is turned into HTML:

NOTE: This is a note.
It includes extra info that a reader might need to know.

TIP: Here's a tip.
A tip provides useful information that can help a user do something or understand something.

IMPORTANT: This is important information that the reader must be aware of so they don't do something that they shouldn't.

CAUTION: A caution advises the reader to act carefully.
Use this in rare circumstances.

WARNING: And this is a warning that informs of danger or harm.
This one should be used very rarely, as well.


If you're authoring new content, you'll want to review this section for some nitty-gritty details.


== Document headers

Each AsciiDoc file header goes directly underneath the document title (see <<Headings>>).

You won't need to touch any of the parameters in this heading.


== Tables

Here's syntax for a basic table:

....
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| heading column 1
| heading column 2
| row 1 column 1 | row 1 column 2
| row 2 column 1 | row 2 column 2
|===
....

There are _many_ ways to format a table.
Refer to the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables[AsciiDoctor User Manual^] for additional help.

== Task headings

If you're explaining how to perform a task, you might include introductory information before you get to the steps.
And you might need to say what to do after completing the steps.
If you do, it's best to organize that information using headers, which enables scanning.

Use the following headings as needed:

.What you'll need

_The information the user needs to complete the task._

.About this task

_Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task._

.Steps

_The individual steps to complete the task._

.What's next?

_What the user should do next._

Each of these should include a `.` right before the text, like so:

....
.What you'll need
.About this task
.Steps
.What's next?
....

This syntax applies bold text in a larger font.

== Code & syntax highlighting


[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
For inline code, enclose it with ` to apply monospace font:
....
`volume show -is-encrypted true`
....
|For inline code, enclose it with ` to apply monospace font: `volume show -is-encrypted true`

| For code blocks: the html in the square brackets tells the compiler that this is html source code for source highlighting.

....
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

----
....
|
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

----

|===

== Content reuse and including files

If you have a chunk of content that's repeated across different pages, you can easily write it once and reuse it across those pages.
Reuse is possible from within the same repository and across repositories.
In the files where you'd like to reuse content:

. If you're reusing the content from within the _same_ repository, use the following syntax on a line by itself:
+
 include::<filename>.adoc[]


. If you're reusing the content in a _different_ repository, use the following syntax on a line by itself:
+
 include::<FILE_RAW_URL>[]
