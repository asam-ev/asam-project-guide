== GitLab issues

In ASAM projects, GitLab is used to manage the standard development processes.
GitLab issues that are documentation related are created by workgroup members and technical writers.
This section contains information on documentation related GitLab issues.

=== Life-cycles for GitLab issues

This section displays the GitLab issue life-cycles when creating documentation for __{asam}__ and explains labels used in GitLab for specific life-cycles.

* Every documentation related GitLab issue shall have a `isDocumentationRelated` label.
* If a GitLab issue is ready for creating content for the documentation, the workgroup members assign the `isReadyForServiceProvider` label to the issue.
* If a technical writer starts working on the documentation, the technical writer assigns the `isInProgress` label to the GitLab issue.
* If a technical writer has questions regarding a GitLab issue, the technical writer assigns the `needsClarification` label to the issue and adds the questions as a comment.
* If a GitLab issue has been finally edited by a technical writer, the technical writer assigns the `needsReview` label to the issue.
* All GitLab issues labeled `needsReview` will be discussed in the upcoming project meeting.
The technical writer presents the changes to the workgroup members.
* If the changes are accepted by the workgroup members, the GitLab issue is closed.
* If there are objections regarding a change to the documentation, a new iteration process starts.
Objections are communicated by the workgroup members and added as comments to the GitLab issue.

== Editorial rules

In the ASAM Editorial Guide, editorial rules exist.
workgroup members and technical writers shall apply the rules when creating documentation for ASAM.
This section contains information on how to create and apply editorial rules.

=== Using editorial rules

. Provide the ASAM Editorial Guide to workgroup members and technical writers when a project starts.
. workgroup members should try to apply the editorial rules.
. Technical writers may educate workgroup members who do not apply the editorial rules.
. Technical writers shall review the content committed by workgroup members as soon as possible.

=== Applying and creating rules

When creating documentation for ASAM, the following approach is applicable:

. Check if an appropriate editorial rule exists in the ASAM Editorial Guide when creating documentation.
.. If an editorial rule exists, apply the rule to the documentation.
.. If no editorial rule exists, create a new rule.

In the list of editorial rules, each rule can be assigned one of the following three status tags:

[%header, cols="2*"]
|===
|Status tag |Description
|draft      |The `draft` tag is assigned to editorial rules that have been created and are not approved yet.
|approved   |The `approved` tag is assigned to editorial rules the OpenX team agreed on and that shall be applied when crating documentation for ASAM.
|rejected   |The `rejected` tag is assigned to editorial rules the OpenX team did not agree on and that shall not be applied when crating documentation for ASAM.

[#sec-18931c78-0dc9-46a5-9e4d-e00c39c7ce8b]
=== Creating new editorial rules

Start the process of creating new editorial rules when an error in the documentation becomes obvious, for example, when sentences in lists sometimes end with a period and sometimes not.

=== Adding an editorial rule to rules.csv

The `rules.csv` file contains a list of all editorial rules.

* Create a rule ID in `rules.csv` file if no rule exists.
* Tag the created editorial rule in the `rules.csv` file as `draft`.

*Example*

[source, csv]
----
ID,Short_Description,Link_to_Project_Guide,Link_to_Test,Status
ASM-1,No fixed versioning,-,-,draft

|Column                |Description
|ID                    |Assign a new unique identifier following the convention `ASM-[number]`, for example, `ASM-1`.
|Short_Description     |Add a short description that explains the subject of the editorial rule.
|Link_to_Project_Guide |Add a link to the section in the ASAM Editorial Guide that contains information on the editorial rule.
|Link_to_Test          |Add a link to the file that contains the automatic test.
|Status                |Assign the status for a new editorial rule, for example, `draft`.

=== Adding an editorial rule to the ASAM Editorial Guide

This section contains information on how to add an editorial rule

. Create a new section in the ASAM Editorial Guide.
. Add a tag to the section following the convention `[#sec-[ID]]`, for example, `[#sec-ASM-2]`.
. Brainstorm how to document the specific editorial rule.
. Have a look at existing resources:
.. Check if an editorial rule exists in the https://asd-ste100.org/request.html[ASD-STE100 Specification] (Simplified Technical English).
.. Check if an editorial rule exists in the https://developers.google.com/style/[Google developer documentation style guide] and the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/[Microsoft Writing Style Guide].
. Extract useful editorial rules from the existing resources.
. Adjust the wording in editorial rules when transferring rules to the ASAM Editorial Guide, for example, Microsoft names subunits of a list items, that are named elements at ASAM.
. Draft the section for the editorial rule in the ASAM Editorial Guide.
. Have a look if an automatic test exists, for example, for https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[Vale].
. Add a link to the section of the editorial rule and, if applicable, a link the file for the automatic test to the `rules.csv` file.
