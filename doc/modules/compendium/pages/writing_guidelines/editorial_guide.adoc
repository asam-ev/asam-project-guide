[#sec-ASM-43]
=== Use backticks for inline literals (ASM-43)

* Do not use pairs of double backticks (\\`` ``).

In AsciiDoc, double backticks are used https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/text/monospace/#unconstrained[for text formatting in certain cases].
Unfortunately, this causes poor wording and readability and therefore shall not be used.

*Example*

[#tab-ce27729f-33c4-47b2-a579-e7a1c2434c3a]
.Use backticks for inline literals
[%header]
