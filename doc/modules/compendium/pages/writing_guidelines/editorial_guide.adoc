== Basics

* Consistent formatting
** Stick to *one spelling* for a word that allows several spellings (e-mail, email, E-mail).
** Stick to *one style* to present information (steps always as numbered lists).
** Stick to *one formatting* for a special purpose (first use of technical term: _italic_)
* Typographic conventions
////
=== Typographic conventions for XiL

AsciiDoc offers markup characters for words and terms.
Here is how to use them correctly _in the floating text_ for XiL:

* _Italic_
** Markup character: Underscore (_)
*** Example: `+++_term_+++`
** Use italic in the following cases:
*** For glossary terms
*** For new terms
*** To emphasize terms
* _Code elements_
** Markup character: Backtick (\`)
*** Example: `+++`term`+++` +
** Use code elements for:
*** Names of classes
*** Names of attributes
*** Names of parameters
*** One-line code examples
*** File names
** For plural forms: Never add a plural _'-s'_ to code element names. Use _"instances/elements/objects/types of <name>"_ instead.

** <<../template/task_template.adoc, Task>>
** <<../template/uml_element_template.adoc, UML element>>

== Source code and literals

This section contains editorial rules on how to write down source code.


[#sec-ASM-14]
=== Create an anchor with an UUID for a referenced code block (ASM-14)

The code block anchor consists of `[#`, the string `code-`, a following UUID, and `]`.

*Exceptions*

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `[#tag-uid]` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

*Example*

[#sec-ASM-88]
=== Use AsciiDoc syntax for source code snippets (ASM-88)

If you cannot or do not want to reference a source code file, you can add source code as a snippet to your AsciiDoc file.
In case of future changes, be aware that you have to maintain two places: your original source code and the snippet in the AsciiDoc file.

*Instructions*

To add source code snippets:

. Copy the part of source code you want to use as a snippet.
. Paste the snippet into your AsciiDoc file.
. Insert the following information:
    * an ID (refer to <<#sec-ASM-78>>)
    * a caption
    * additional information as comma-separated values with spaces
    * delimiters

The following additional information shall or may be used:

* Always use `source`.
* Add the source code language for syntax highlighting. For example, `osc2`, `xml`, or `java`.
* Always use `linenums`.

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

[.underline]#Code#

```
[#code-1e787b21-eb85-4582-9763-6c2319770928]

[#sec-ASM-43]
=== Use a single grave accent before and after inline literals (ASM-43)

* Use a single grave accent U+0060, also called backtick, (`++`++`) before and after inline literals.
* Do not use pairs of double grave accents (`++``++`).

In AsciiDoc, double grave accents are used https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/text/monospace/#unconstrained[for text formatting in certain cases].
Unfortunately, this causes poor wording and readability and therefore shall not be used.

*Exceptions*

There are no exceptions.

*Example*

=== Mark up ASAM XML elements (ASM-121)

* For XML elements, use the name of the element in angle brackets (`++<>++`) and backticks (`++``++`), and afterwards the word "element" or "elements".
* For attributes, use the at symbol (`++@++`) and the name of the element.
Optional: Use the words "attribute" or "attributes".
* Do not use the plural of the name of XML elements or attributes.

*Exceptions*

In ASAM OpenSCENARIO, use the following highlighting:

* For XML elements, use the name of the element in backticks (`++``++`).
Optional: Use the words "instance" or "instances".
* For XML attributes, use the name of the attribute in backticks (`++``++`).
Optional: Use the words "attribute" or "attributes".

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `[#tag-uid]` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

// TODO: Where to use a semantic ID and where a UUID? What are allowed characters in IDs anyway? How about a Regex for a valid ID production: [a-zA-Z0-9_-]
