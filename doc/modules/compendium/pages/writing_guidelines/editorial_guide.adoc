[#sec-ASM-8]
=== Use lists with similarly structured items for complex text (ASM-8)

For example, each item should be a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.

*Example*

```
The outline of the road marking is described by the attributes @length and @space:

* @length represents the visible part of the line.
* @space describes the non-visible part.
