== Lists

These editorial rules apply to lists:

[#sec-ASM-8]
=== Use lists with similarly structured items for complex text (ASM-8)

Use lists instead of long sentences to present complex text in a way that is easier to read and understand.
The list items shall be a set of similarly structured items.
For example, each item should be a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.

*Example*

```
The outline of the road marking is described by the attributes @length and @space:

* @length represents the visible part of the line.
* @space describes the non-visible part.
```

* Microsoft Style Guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/lists
* Google Developer Documentation Style Guide: https://developers.google.com/style/lists

[#sec-ASM-47]
=== Use AsciiDoc syntax for lists (ASM-47)

Use only asciidoc syntax to format lists.
Use either ordered or unordered lists.

*Example*

```
Unordered list
* This is an item.
* This is another item.
* This is an additional item.

Ordered list
. This is the first item.
. This is the second item.
. This is the third item.

```

=== Start each list item in a list with an uppercase letter (ASM-5)

*Example*

```
* This is the first sentence.
* This is the second sentence.
* This is the third sentence.
```

*Exceptions*

If a list item starts with one of the following, do not use an uppercase letter:

* Code elements +
For example: * `<elevation>` elements shall be defined in ascending order according to the s-coordinate.
* Mathematical signs +
For example: * `x` and `y`
* URLs +
For example: * http://www.asam.net

[#sec-ASM-10]
=== Choose a suitable type of list (ASM-10)

==== Use a bulleted list for things that have something in common but do not need to appear in a particular order.

*Example*

```
The database owner can:

* Create and delete a database.
* Add, delete, or modify a document.
* Add, delete, or modify any information in the database
```

*Source*

Microsoft Style Guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/lists#bulleted-lists

==== Use a numbered list for sequential items (like a procedure) or prioritized items (like a top 10 list).

*Example*

```
To sign on to a database:

1. On the File menu, select Open database.
2. In Username, enter your name.
3. In Password, enter your password, and then select OK.
```

[#sec-ASM-11]

If an item in a list is not a full sentence, then do not put the following punctuation or conjunctions:

* Full stops (periods)
* Semicolons
* Commas
* Conjunctions like and or or

== Source code examples

These rules apply to source code examples:

[#sec-ASM-43]
=== Use backticks for inline literals (ASM-43)

* Use pairs of single backticks (` `) for inline literals.
* Do not use pairs of double backticks (\\`` ``).

In AsciiDoc, double backticks are used https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/text/monospace/#unconstrained[for text formatting in certain cases].
Unfortunately, this causes poor wording and readability and therefore shall not be used.

*Example*

[#tab-ce27729f-33c4-47b2-a579-e7a1c2434c3a]
.Use backticks for inline literals
[%header]
|===
|No |#Yes#
|[.line-through]#The example below shows the structure of an \\``Act``.#                             |The example below shows the structure of an \`Act`.
|[.line-through]#Movements of vehicles in \\``Act`` are defined in the \``ManeuverGroup``s section.# |Movements of vehicles in \`Act` are defined in the \`ManeuverGroup` section.

*Example*

```

.This is the caption of the table
|===
|cell 1_1 | cell 1_2 | cell 1_3
|cell 2_1 | cell 2_2 | cell 2_3
