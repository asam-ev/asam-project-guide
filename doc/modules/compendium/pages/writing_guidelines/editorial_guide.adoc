== List of editorial rules

This section contains a list of the entire editorial rules.

== Basics

* Consistent formatting
** Stick to *one spelling* for a word that allows several spellings (e-mail, email, E-mail).
** Stick to *one style* to present information (steps always as numbered lists).
** Stick to *one formatting* for a special purpose (first use of technical term: _italic_)
* Typographic conventions
////
=== Typographic conventions for XiL

AsciiDoc offers markup characters for words and terms.
Here is how to use them correctly _in the floating text_ for XiL:

* _Italic_
** Markup character: Underscore (_)
*** Example: `+++_term_+++`
** Use italic in the following cases:
*** For glossary terms
*** For new terms
*** To emphasize terms
* _Code elements_
** Markup character: Backtick (\`)
*** Example: `+++`term`+++` +
** Use code elements for:
*** Names of classes
*** Names of attributes
*** Names of parameters
*** One-line code examples
*** File names
** For plural forms: Never add a plural _'-s'_ to code element names. Use _"instances/elements/objects/types of <name>"_ instead.

|[.line-through]#Create six `MyVector`**s**.# |Create six instances of `MyVector`.
|===

** See <<Source code>> for more details on source code.
* _Bold_
** Markup character: Asterisk (*)
*** Example: `+++*term*+++`
** Do not use bold for terms in floating text.
** This markup is reserved for
*** Structuring elements, like sub-headings that should not appear in the table of contents.
*** Emphasis, for example single characters in formulae or tables.
////
* Use templates
////
=== Use templates
* Adoc-templates are available for common types of topics.
Use them to create consistent content.
* Each template contains instructions on how to use the template and sample text that has to be replaced.
* Currently available templates:
** <<../template/generic_template.adoc, Generic>>
** <<../template/task_template.adoc, Task>>
** <<../template/uml_element_template.adoc, UML element>>
** <<../template/use_case_template.adoc, Use case>>
////
* Use existing foreword

== Combined Rules from writing guides /XIL




[#sec-ASM-76]
=== Uppercase and lowercase (ASM-76)

Refer to <<#sec-ASM-50>>


[#sec-ASM-77]
=== XIL: IDs (aka anchors) (ASM-77)

Refer to <<#sec-ASM-78>>

*Source*

ASAM Writing Guide: XIL: Tags (aka anchors)


[#sec-ASM-78]
=== Insert a unique ID for topics, figures, tables, source code, and sections (ASM-78)

Insert a unique ID according to the following patterns:

[#tab-a0bf23cc-3f35-4f3a-9788-6436c90d29b3]
.List of patterns for unique IDs
[%header]
|===
|Pattern | usage | optional/required | comment
|`[#code-<uid>]` | source code blocks | optional | Only use if source code is referenced.
|`[#fig-<uid>]` | figures (images, diagrams, and so on) | required | -
|`[#map-<uid>]` | map files | optional | Only use for map_[...].adoc files.
|`[#sec-<uid>]` | sections | optional | Only use if section is referenced.
|`[#tab-<uid>]` | tables | required | -
|`[#top-<uid>]` | topics | required | -
|===

*Exceptions*

If you do not know how to use unique IDs, insert `[#tag-uid]` as a placeholder.
The placeholder will trigger a pipeline warning so that the technical writer can help with creating a unique ID.

NOTE: Where to use a semantic ID and where a UUID? What are allowed characters in IDs anyway? How about a Regex for a valid ID production: [a-zA-Z0-9_-]

*Example*

[#tab-682fa239-bf8f-4531-a825-e9485372479b]
