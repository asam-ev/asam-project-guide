*Example*

```
The outline of the road marking is described by the attributes @length and @space:

* @length represents the visible part of the line.
* @space describes the non-visible part.
```

[#sec-ASM-10]
=== Choose a suitable type of list (ASM-10)

==== Use a bulleted list for things that have something in common but donâ€™t need to appear in a particular order.

* Add, delete, or modify a document.
* Add, delete, or modify any information in the database
```

```
To sign on to a database:

1. On the File menu, select Open database.
2. In Username, enter your name.
3. In Password, enter your password, and then select OK.

These rules apply to source code examples:

[#sec-ASM-43]
=== Use backticks for inline literals (ASM-43)

* Use pairs of single backticks (` `) for inline literals.
* Do not use pairs of double backticks (\\`` ``).

In AsciiDoc, double backticks are used https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/text/monospace/#unconstrained[for text formatting in certain cases].
Unfortunately, this causes poor wording and readability and therefore shall not be used.

.Use backticks for inline literals
