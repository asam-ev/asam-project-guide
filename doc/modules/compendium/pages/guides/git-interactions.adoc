== Commit / Push / Pull

Make any changes. Once you are ready to share them, upload them to the remote

=== Git Bash to Commit / Push / Pull
git bash commands to commit and push changes

    git add . # add your changes to the tracked versioning of git
    git commit -m "<SHORT MESSAGE DETAILING CHANGES>" # this message will be visible to anyone
    git push # push or upload the changes you made to the remote version of the branch you are on

to pull the latest changes, open the git bash in the repository folder (or change into the folder in the bash)

    git pull

=== Git Commit / Push / Pull using VS-Code

to commit the changes in VS-Code, change to the source control (using the side bar), here you will find a list of changed files. +
Please select all the files you want to commit (this is called staging). When hovering over the file with the mouse the "+" Button will appear, use this to stage.
When hovering over the "CHANGES" Column you can stage all the changes

Now enter your commit message, and use the "checkmark"-Button to complete your commit

The last step in the process is to upload/push your commit(s). So far all your changes are only locally on your system. Open the menu for the source control, using the three points "...". Here you can find the commands "Push" and also "Pull".

Now other project members will be able to review and comment on your changes


Once everyone is happy with the changes, the merge request will be accepted and the changes made will be integrated with the master branch, deleting the originally merged branch and closing the request & associated issues.

Only project members with the role of "maintainer" can accept merge requests onto the master branch - these are decided on in project meetings. Get in touch with an ASAM rep if you want to apply for this role.
