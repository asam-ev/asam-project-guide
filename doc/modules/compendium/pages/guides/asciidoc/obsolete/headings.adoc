You can have only one page title, but you can have multiple section titles.
For example, you might have three level 1 sections that include level 2 and 3 sections:

[cols="a,a"]

....
= Page title
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section

== Level 1 section

== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section

== Level 1 section
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section
