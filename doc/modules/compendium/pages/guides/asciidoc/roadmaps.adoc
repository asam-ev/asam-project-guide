This chapters shows how to include roadmaps in an ASAM standard.

CAUTION: Asciidoc preview in VSCode renders the roadmap but does not apply the correct theme ("neutral"). Reason is unclear.

CAUTION: Asciidoctor can render mermaid with '-r asciidoctor-diagram' when 'mmdc' is installed. But currently it is not possible to install 'mmdc' in the standard asciidoctor docker image (based on alpine)
