You might want to draw attention to certain statements by creating notes or tips - so-called https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/#admonitions[admonitions^].

Use each of these sparingly.
You don't want to create pages that are full of notes and tips.
They become less meaningful if you do.

Here's what each of these looks like when the AsciiDoc content is turned into HTML:

NOTE: This is a note.
It includes extra info that a reader might need to know.

TIP: Here's a tip.
A tip provides useful information that can help a user do something or understand something.

IMPORTANT: This is important information that the reader must be aware of so they don't do something that they shouldn't.

CAUTION: A caution advises the reader to act carefully.
Use this in rare circumstances.

WARNING: And this is a warning that informs of danger or harm.
This one should be used very rarely, as well.

If you're authoring new content, you'll want to review this section for some nitty-gritty details.
