Once a document is written by the group/service provider, we want to review and comment on the document.
Unfortunatelly, there is no native built-in comment feature in GitLab and/or __{vscode}__.
Also everyone / every  workgroup is working on their own branch.
Those branches should be create by using the issues in GitLab.

Once we have this branch, we can get started working on the content, during our work/review/... we recognize things we want to change, discuss, review, etc.
There are now to possibilities how to handle his process, either use the comment feature in the issues and describe where and what you want to annotate.

Another and quicker way to comment directly in the document can be used when installing the __{vscode}__ Extension "Comment Anchor".

Comment Anchor provides a possiblity to set highlighted comments and comment types directly in the text.
There are several possiblities of comment types.

. ANCHOR: this is a regular comment
. TODO: here some work still needs to be done
. NOTE: add a comment or hint
. REVIEW: add your review comments to this anchor
. FIXME: you found a mistake in a document
. STUB: t.b.d

The list above looks like this in the __{vscode}__ Editor:

The Anchor is tied to the Word (e.g. ANCHOR).

How would this look like in an adoc file:

////
TODO:  there is still work to do on this chapter
FIXME: in this image there is an error
NOTE:  I have to create an image of this comment section as it will not be visible in the compiled document of this how-to

////

TIP: Have a look into the raw file to find the comments

Now, the big question still open is when to use the issue comment section and when to use the anchors.
As you can see in the image below, a new branch is create with an issue, the major progress you make should be documented in the ticket.
For detailed comments that relate to a section/image/chapter of your document use the anchors.

Now we have all those anchors in our document, how to find them again?
To solve this issue, you can open the "Comment Anchor" Menu via the __{vscode}__ sidebar (marked as `1`).
Now, the below window opens and we have two seperate possiblities to check our comments.
First, we have an overview about the comments in the acitve file (marked as `2`) and we can scan the whole workspace for comments and get that overview (marked as `3`)
