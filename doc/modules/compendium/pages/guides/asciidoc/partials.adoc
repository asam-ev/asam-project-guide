:description: How-To for reusing content from other files.
:keywords: asciidoc,reuse,include,how-to, READYFORREVIEW


If you have a chunk of content that's repeated across different pages, you can easily write it once and reuse it across those pages.
Reuse is possible from within the same repository and across repositories.
In the files where you'd like to reuse content:

. If you're reusing the content from within the _same_ repository, use the following syntax on a line by itself:
+
 include::<filename>.adoc[]


. If you're reusing the content in a _different_ repository, use the following syntax on a line by itself:
+
 include::<FILE_RAW_URL>[]
