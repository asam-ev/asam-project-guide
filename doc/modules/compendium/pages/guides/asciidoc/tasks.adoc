If you're explaining how to perform a task, you might include introductory information before you get to the steps.
And you might need to say what to do after completing the steps.
If you do, it's best to organize that information using headers, which enables scanning.

Use the following headings as needed:

.What you'll need

_The information the user needs to complete the task._

.About this task

_Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task._

.Steps

_The individual steps to complete the task._

.What's next?

_What the user should do next._

Each of these should include a `.` right before the text, like so:

....
.What you'll need
.About this task
.Steps
.What's next?
....

This syntax applies bold text in a larger font.
