== Switch to a other branch on your local copy

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to use pull the latest updates from the repository before switching branches, otherwise you could run into trouble on your local system due to file conflicts.

=== Switch branch using the git bash

    git fetch origin # update your local copy with all changes in the remote version
    git checkout -b "BRANCH_NAME" "origin/BRANCHNAME" # switch to the branch

=== Switch branch using git graph

To use Git Graph switch to the integrated Source Control of VS-Code and activate Git Graph (top left side, marked in the image below). +
Now select a desired branch and open the Context Menu to use the "Checkout Branch" command, now your local repository is changed to that branch.
