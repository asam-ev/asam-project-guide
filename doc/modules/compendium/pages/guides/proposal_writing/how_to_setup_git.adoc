== Context
The basis for collaboration at ASAM is GitLab.
In order for project members and the project lead to work on their respective project, a new repository has to be created.

== Result
A new proposal repository has been created and the link been provided to all current project members.

== Prerequisites
* The idea has been proposed and approved in the xref:standardization:project-ideation.adoc[Ideation Phase].

== How

. In case of a new standard, https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/#creating-a-subgroup[create a new subgroup^] in the group https://code.asam.net/simulation[Simulation^] with the target name of the standard.
+
NOTE: If this is an evolution of an existing standard, use the existing subgroup instead
. xref:compendium:tools/gitlab/forking_repo.adoc[Fork] the latest version of the https://code.asam.net/common/templates/proposal-template[proposal template repository^] into this subgroup.
. Rename the forked project to `<THIS_STANDARD> Proposal`, where `<THIS_STANDARD>` is the target name of the standard.
. Add all current project members and the project lead (ideagiver) to the subgroup.
. Send a mail with the link to the new project to the group, informing them that the repository is now ready for use.
