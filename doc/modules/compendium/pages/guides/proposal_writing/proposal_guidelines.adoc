== Gather topics in issues
{recommended}

Use issues to collect topics and tasks for the proposal writing.
If this is an evolution of an existing ASAM standard, consider colleting and using backlog issues from the previous project.

For more information on how to work with issues regarding the proposal writing, see xref:compendium:guides/proposal_writing/contribute_with_issues.adoc[]

=== Use issue templates
{mandatory}

When working with issues, use the provided issue templates in the proposal repository.
Each issue template contains a description (as comments) on when to use them and what content to add where.

=== Label issues correctly
{mandatory}

When working with issues, make sure that each issues related to the proposal phase contains the label `Proposal`.

NOTE: If you use the <<Use issue templates,issue templates>> provided in the proposal repository, the label is automatically assigned.
