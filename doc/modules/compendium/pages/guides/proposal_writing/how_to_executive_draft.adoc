== Context
To start a new project with a xref:standardization:proposal-phase.adoc[Project Proposal], it first needs a Project Proposal Executive Draft for internal analysis.
It also is the basis for the xref:compendium:guides/proposal_writing/how_to_proposal_document.adoc[Project Proposal Draft] before the {proposal-workshop}.
This guide explains how to create such an Executive Draft and what to look out for when doing so.

== Result
An initial draft for managament and executives, containing a basic executive summary and, optionally, further details.

NOTE: The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files.
The Executive Draft described here is currently created as a Word document based on a simple template in order to minimize any entry barrier.

== Prerequisites
* The idea has been proposed and approved in the xref:standardization:project-ideation.adoc[Ideation Phase].
* The proposal needs at least four (4) partner companies (the idea-giver + 3).
* The xref:compendium:guides/proposal_writing/how_to_setup_git.adoc[project repostiory] has been set up by the {gtm}.

== How

=== Working in GitLab
. Log into {gitlab-url}[GitLab] and access the proposal project with the url the {gtm} provided
. Fill in the standard structure as follows: +

TIP: The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be.

.. Add a comprehensive 'Executive Summary' outlining the general idea of the proposed project
.. (Optional) Add further information in the other sections, where possible.
. Discuss and optimize the document with your ASAM representative
