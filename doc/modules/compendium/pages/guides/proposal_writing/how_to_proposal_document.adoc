== Context
In case a new project is proposed, the first step is to create an xref:compendium:guides/proposal_writing/how_to_executive_draft.adoc[Executive Draft] for internal analysis.
Based on this draft, a rough Proposal Draft is then created that contains further details needed for the {proposal-workshop}.
This Proposal Draft is then further expanded and detailed until it is ready for submission to the {tsc}.

== Result
A valid Project Proposal is created that can be brought to decision by the {tsc}.

NOTE: The final Project Proposal document is generated based on Asciidoc files, but the initial executive draft may be a Word document.
For proposal submission, the proposal document must be converted into the appropriate Asciidoc structure.

== Prerequisites
TODO

* The idea has been proposed and approved in the xref:standardization:project-ideation.adoc[Ideation Phase].
* The proposal needs at least four (4) partner companies (the idea-giver + 3).

== How
. Download the https://code.asam.net/common/templates/proposal-template[Executive Draft template^]
// TODO: Update link and add correct template
. Fill in the standard structure as follows: +

TIP: The more details you add initially, the easier it is for ASAM to understand and support your proposal and the deeper and more focussed the discussions in the workshops will be.

.. Add a comprehensive 'Executive Summary' outlining the general idea of the proposed project
.. Describe the reasons for this proposed project in the 'Motivation' section
.. Define a set of (initial) use cases in the 'Use Cases' section
.. (Optional) If you know of other standards this proposal relates to (ASAM or other), list them in the 'Relations to Other Standards or Organizations' section
. (Optional) Create an initial structure for the section 'Technical Content' and fill write as much project specific content as possible
. Discuss and optimize the document with your ASAM representative
. Send in the completed document as a rough Proposal Draft for the {proposal-workshop}

NOTE: The sections 'Project Ressources' and 'Project Plan' will be filled out at a later stage and do not need to be edited in this draft.
