= What is YAML/yml?
:description: Describes the term YAML (yml) and what it means.
:keywords: yml,yaml

YAML is a data-serialization language that is human-readable.
It is similar to XML and has a very minimal syntax.
Its file type is `.yml`.

In the context of docker, YAML files are used to give instructions to docker-compose (as docker-compose.yml, e.g. the xref:tool-specific/StandardDockerConfig.adoc[default project docker-compose.yml]) or for building complex page structures (such as with Antora).
