The AsciiDoc extension for Visual Studio Code (see xref:{vscode-extensions}#_asciidoc[Recommended Visual Studio Code Extensions]) comes with the ability to include Kroki diagrams.
However, it is deactivated by default and must be configured before first use.

This requires a diagram server.
There are multiple options:

. Use the public kroki.io server
. Deploy your own server
. https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[Run a kroki docker container^] on your local machine

We will go with option 1.

WARNING: This extension will send graph information to https://kroki.io.
If this is an issue, it is also possible to use your own kroki instance (see https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[here for more information^]).

To enable diagram support, set the use_kroki parameter in your User Settings to true.
