The __Simulation__ domain at {asam} uses a repository-based standardization approach built around {gitlab-url}[GitLab^]. +
Proposals, concept papers and standards are written as AsciiDoc files.
All project content is stored, organized, versioned and discussed through a repository on {gitlab-url}[GitLab^], which is provided by {asam}.
The GitLab pipeline creates the required final documents, typically as `.html` or as `.pdf`.
