= Issue triage - managing unedited issues

//tag::body[]

In ASAM projects, tasks are divided into individual issues.
This enables a simpler and clearer processing of task packages.
These issues have to be maintained to keep an overview and to get a benefit from the use of issues.
Experience has shown that unmaintained issues result in an unclear repository and therefore the open tasks cannot be clearly identified.
Therefore, a process has been defined to get rid of unprocessed issues.

[NOTE]
====
A clean issue contains the following things:

- active milestone
- backlog or active_issue label
- assignee
- workgroup label
