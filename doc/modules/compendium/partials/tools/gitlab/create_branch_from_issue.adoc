The general idea is: Whenever an issue is opened, a branch is created with it.
Thus, it is possible to work on the issue in an individual branch and merge that branch back to `main` after the issue is done.

. Create an issue, using one of the available templates.
+

. Fill out the neccessary fields.
Keep the size of the issue reasonable, for example by trying to have it cover about 8 hours of work.

. Open your issue and create your branch from it.
Follow the xref:compendium:tools/gitlab/branch_naming_conventions.adoc[] for the branch name.
+

. Now, the ticket is created and we can start working on the issue.
When working on the issue, document your progress to be able to know when the task is done.
Please keep the documentation for the progress short and simple.

. If there are open points that need to be discussed with the group, start a new thread in the issue so others can reply to your suggestion or question

+
A thread in an issue looks like the image below.
+

. As soon as the issue is done, create a merge request for the branch to start an internal review.
