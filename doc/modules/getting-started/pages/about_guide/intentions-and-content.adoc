The ASAM Project Guide intends to gather all general knowledge on what a standard is, how to participate in creating a standard works and all related topics.
The target audience is both interested non-ASAM members (information on ASAM and how to get involved), ASAM members (instructions on tasks and processes depending on roles) and external suppliers (processes, tools, guides).
