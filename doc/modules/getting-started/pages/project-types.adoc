__{asam}__ has four defined project types, which further characterize the work to be done within the projects. They are:

* <<Standard development project>>
* <<Implementation project>>
* <<Concept project>>
* <<Study project>>


They all have in common that the primary output of the project is a standard. The upper limit for subsidiary funding from __{asam}__ is 25% of the total required project budget.

== Standard development project
The core of __{asam}_ is to carry out standard development projects with the goal to create new standards and to update existing standards in accordance with the demands of ASAM members and market requirements. _{asam}__ defines four types of standard development projects, depending on the expected magnitude of changes to the standard:

* <<New standard development>>
* <<Major version development>>
* <<Minor version development>>
* <<Revision development>>

They all have in common that the primary output of the project is a standard. The upper limit for subsidiary funding from __{asam}__ is 25% of the total required project budget.
