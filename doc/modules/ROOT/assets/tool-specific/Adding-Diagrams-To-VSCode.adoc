= Adding VSCode Support For Diagrams With Kroki
:imagesdir: ../images

The kroki extension supports a wide range of diagrams from BPMN to Graphviz to PlantUML and Vega graphs using kroki and asciidoctor-kroki.

You can see the full range and examples on the https://kroki.io/examples.html[website].

include::Recommended-VSCode-Settings.adoc[tag=kroki]

== Caching Diagrams Locally

NOTE: This is a per-file setting and must be done in each applicable AsciiDoc file.

By default, diagrams are not saved locally. To cache and save diagrams locally, set the kroki-fetch-diagram attribute in your document header:

    = My Amazing Document
    :kroki-fetch-diagram:

This will store images by default in your document folder. However, you may also set `imagesdir` to store them elsewhere:

    = My Amazing Document
    :kroki-fetch-diagram:
    :imagesdir: media

The images are served over http:// and you must allow your preview to include data from unsafe sources. To do this, open your command palette (ctrl+shift+P) and enter ``asciidoc preview security`` and choose ``Allow insecure content``. 

NOTE: Access to this global setting is only available if you have currently are in an AsciiDoc file in VSCode. Otherwise, the setting will not show up.

== Testing Kroki Examples

With the settings done and caching activated, you can test Kroki with the following examples:
