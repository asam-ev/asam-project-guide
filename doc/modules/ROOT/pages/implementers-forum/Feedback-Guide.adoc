== Overview On The Different Feedback Mechanisms

=== Feedback Stages

This is the list of feedback stages a feedback issue undergoes during its lifetime:

[cols="1,1,1"]
[frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
h| Stage/Label | Issue state | Description

| ~IF-InternalReview
| open
|  Internal discussion and review in the Implementers Forum

| ~IF-DevProjectActionNeeded
| open
| Waiting for answers or proposals for solutions from Development Project. This might be either addressed in Q&A live sessions or via gitlab comments. The state may change back to ~IF-InternalReview if all questions are answered and no further need for action is identified.

| ~IF-DevProjectInProgress
| open
| Development project is working on a solution including consultation of Implementers Forum to agree on solution.

| ~IF-Fixed
| closed
| 'Fixed' in consensus with IF.

| ~IF-WontFix
| closed
| 'Won't fix' in consensus with IF (e.g. out of scope or moved to > 2.0).

|===

This is the workflow in which order an issue may be assigned to a certain stage:

~IF-InternalReview (open) <-->  ~IF-DevProjectActionNeeded -> ~IF-DevProjectInProgress -> \~IF-Fixed/~IF-WontFix (closed)

An overview of all currently available feedback issues you find in the https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/boards/66[IF Feedback Board^].


=== Scenario Specific Feedback
Use the issues created for each scenario https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=ScenarioDescription[link to the list of issues for scenario feedback^].

If you create a new issue for a new scenario, please assign the labels ~ImplementersForum, ~ScenarioDescription and ~IF-InternalReview (and no other labels).

As soon as questions arise that cannot be answered by the Implementers Forum alone, then move the issue from the ~IF-InternalReview stage to ~IF-DevProjectActionNeeded (just drag & drop in the board) and mention the responsible person from the Development Project from this https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/wikis/Contact-Persons-from-OSC2-Development-Project[list^].


=== General Feedback
If you identify a topic that does not only concern one of our example scenarios but many then you may create a new issue for that with the labels ~ImplementersForum, ~GeneralFeedback and ~IF-InternalReview.

But please be spare with such issues and also try to put connected topics into the same issue to not overload the IF Feedback Board.

== Feedback To OSC2 Feature List (Excel Table)
Add your feedback as comment to the respective gitLab issue https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/openscenario-2.0/-/issues/245[Collect feedback to OSC2.0 feature list^].


== General Guidelines For Content Of Given Feedback
=== What should be contained in the IF-feedback from the perspective of the OSC2.0 project to be most valuable and helpful?
- **Ambiguities in the language** (should have high priority)
  - How clear is the intended meaning and use of language constructs and domain model entities?
- Are there any **important features missing for 2.0**?  (e.g. if you cannot express things at all)
- **Ease of expressiveness / Usability / Understandability** e.g.
  - How complicated is it to express simple things (and why)?
  - How difficult is it to write/read scenarios for non-programmers?
  - ...

- Feedback to desired features according to the original proposal like reusability,â€¦

**_General request: Feedback should be constructive and specific not only complains, but also reasons and proposals for improvements if possible._**


=== What Are The Implementers Forum Members Planning/Expecting To Provide (Subgroup A, Subgroup B)?
- Which features were intensively used during specification of different case-studies? => Priority to be contained in 2.0
- For which abstraction level which features were used? => Feature Sets, Usage & Pragmatics Group
- For which use-case which features where used? => Feature Sets, Priorities, Usage & Pragmatics Group
- ...
