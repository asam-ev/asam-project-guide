= What Is YAML/yml?

YAML is a data-serialization language that is human-readable. It is similar to XML and has a very minimal syntax. Its file type is `.yml`.

In the context of docker, YAML files are used to give instructions to docker-compose (as docker-compose.yml, e.g. the <<../tool-specific/StandardDockerConfig.adoc#,default project docker-compose.yml>>) or for building complex page structures (such as with Antora).
