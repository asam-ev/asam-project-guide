== Why Docker?

Docker is a platform where you use so-called containers to run applications in an encapsulated environment. With this, you do not need to install and configure software, programming languages etc: just download and use a pre-configured container that has all the relevant configuration already built in. From the docker homepage:

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

For more information on how to use Docker, see the <<../tool-specific/DockerGuide.adoc#,Docker Guide>> or the <<https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#,official guides>> from Docker.

TIP: Want to learn more about Docker? See link:https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/beginners/components/container-vs-image.html[this page] for an explanation on the definitions of and the differences between images and containers. In short: Images are the blueprints for containers. When executed, an image is used to create a container.

== Docker Licenses

IMPORTANT: Professional use of Docker Desktop in large organizations (more than 250 employees or more than $10 million in annual revenue) *requires users to have a paid Docker subscription*. See https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/.

If your company does not provide docker licenses, you can check the docker website what type of license applies to your company. Note that only Docker Desktop (Windows and Mac) requires license fees. Docker for Linux is (currently) still free under the Apache License, version 2.0.

== Preparations

Docker uses virtualization features that require some setup and have system requirements that need to be met.

=== System Requirements

NOTE: It is recommended to use the WSL2 backend. If this is not possible for you, you can follow the instructions on how to set up for Hyper-V.

.What is WSL?
[%collapsible]
====
WSL is short for Windows Subsystem for Linux. From https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about:

> The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

In the context of Docker, WSL2 and a compatible Linux distribution are used to run containers built for Linux on a Windows computer. In other words, WSL allows you to run a Linux directly within Windows without having to install a new operating system in parallel to your main one (Windows).
====


IMPORTANT: Make sure that you PC fulfills all requirements listed on https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/#system-requirements before installing the downloaded Docker Desktop application!

TIP: To check your windows version, enter `Windows logo key`+`R`, type `winver` and confirm with Enter. Make sure your build number is higher than the required minimum. If not, ask your IT to update your windows build.

=== Preparing Windows

. **Prepare WSL2** on your Computer by following the instructions on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install.

.[.underline]#Read this in case Ubuntu for WSL is not installed automatically#
[%collapsible]
====
The command `wsl --install` is supposed to install both wsl, set it to the correct version (wsl2), and install Ubuntu as your standard Linux distribution. However, if you require a different distribution or the standard distribution is not installed automatically, you can download and install one manually. Run the following command to install Ubuntu manually after having set up WSL:

```
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

To get an overview over what distributions are available, enter

```
wsl --list --online
```
c
====
+
. Make sure your **BIOS-level virtualization support** is enabled (see https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/#wsl-2-backend)


=== Setting Up The Linux Distribution Under Windows
Before first use, the WSL2 Linux distribution must be configured (e.g. a user with password must be created). Follow the instructions on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-user-info.

NOTE: You may reuse your Windows username and password or define a new user alltogether. Note that changing your windows password will not change your Linux user's password since both are independent.

== Getting Docker Desktop

NOTE: Alternatively to getting Docker Desktop, you can also download and install docker engine from binaries. This is free of charge but requires many more steps for setup. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/ for more information on this.

This summary assumes that you are using **Windows**. If not, check out  the link:{docker-download}[official docker page] for information on how to retrieve and install docker.

You can download Docker Desktop (the Docker version for Windows) link:{docker-download}[here].
For more information on how to download and install docker, see https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/.

=== Setting Up Docker Desktop
If all prerequesits have been met and the prepartory steps been executed, install the Docker Desktop app. See also https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/#install-docker-desktop-on-windows.

After setup, you can try the example project to get to know basic Docker commands.
