This is a summary of recommended VSCode settings to follow writing guidelines easier.

== Indentations

. Open the Command Palett (`Ctrl`+ `Shift` + `P`)
. Type "user settings" and confirm with Enter
. Search for "indent" in the user settings
. Enable "Insert Spaces"
. Set "Tab Size" to 4

IMPORTANT: The xref:../writing_guidelines/writing_guide.adoc[writing guide] does not allow any tabs!

== Automatic Removal Of Spaces After Periods

image::VSCodeSettingsWhiteSpace.png[]
. Open the Command Palett (`Ctrl`+ `Shift` + `P`)
. Type "user settings" and confirm with Enter
. Search for "whitespace" in the user settings
. Enable "Trim Trailing Whitespace"

IMPORTANT: The xref:../writing_guidelines/writing_guide.adoc[writing guide] requires a line break after each sentence and no additional space after a period is therefore required!

// tag::kroki[]
== Enabling Kroki Support In AsciiDoc

The AsciiDoc extension for Visual Studio Code (see xref:Recommended-VSCode-Extensions.adoc#AsciiDoc[Recommended Visual Studio Code Extensions]) comes with the ability to include Kroki diagrams. However, it is deactivated by default and must be configured before first use.

This requires a diagram server. There are multiple options:

. use the public kroki.io server
. deploy your own server
. https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[run a kroki docker container] on your local machine

We will go with option 1.

WARNING: This extension will send graph information to https://kroki.io. If this is an issue, it is also possible to use your own kroki instance (see https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/[here for more information]).

To enable diagram support, set the use_kroki parameter in your User Settings to true.
