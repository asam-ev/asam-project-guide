:data-uri:

Visual Studio Code is a powerful code and text editor that can be highly individualized and adapted to the task at hand using the existing extensions for it. Here, you get an overview over how Visual Studio Code is structured. 

For the Visual Studio Code extensions recommended by ASAM as well as specific tutorials, see the links under <<See Also>>. 

== Interface

[yellow]#Editor#:: The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
[blue]#Side Bar#:: Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
[purple]#Status Bar#:: Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
[red]#Activity Bar#:: Change the view in the side bar

== Command Palette

The Command Palette in VSCode allows you to access specific menus and functions of the program directly without having to navigate there through the menu strucutre. It also helps when looking for an option to change as it contains a search function with auto-completion. 

* `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` brings up the Command Palette. 

From here, you have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.

NOTE: Many tutorials in this Wiki for VSCode make use of the Command Palette.

== Activity Bar

The Activity Bar contains a direct access to many important base or extensions features. The following image shows standard functionality, but some extensions like GitLens will add their own icon and features.

// Explorer - shows all of the files and folders you have access to
// Search – Find and replace in files
// Git – all git related commands, only active if in a git repository
// Extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.
