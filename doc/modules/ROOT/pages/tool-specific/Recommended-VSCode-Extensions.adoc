= Recommended Visual Studio Code Extensions

VSCode is already without extensions very powerful and user friendly. One thing that can make the VSCode experience even better are the extensions. There is a list of extensions we recommend that will make your life contributing to the ASAM standards way easier.

Installing an extension is really easy, just enter the extension menu, search for the desired extension. Than click on the Install-Button.

== AsciiDoc

The AsciiDoc extension will add the syntax the AsciiDoc interpreter to VSCode so you can use the preview feature and have syntax highlighting.

The Git Graph extension is a great tool navigating the branches in the git repository and provides a great overview.

== GitLens

The GitLens Extension is a great extension to follow up on all the changes made to the documents within the repository.
Gitlens provides:

* Repository Overview
* File History
* Line History
* Commit Comparison

The extension also lets you search for all available anchors in the repository or current file and offers a jump-to option.

== Draw.io

// tag::drawio-extension[]

The Draw.io extension for Visual Sudio Code allows for easy creation and assisted editing of drawio and other files supported by Draw.io within Visual Studio Code. For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension. You can access that documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace.

.Draw.io Integration (id: hediet.vscode-drawio)
image::install_drawio.png[alt=Search and find the extension 'Draw.io Integration']

NOTE: The Draw.io extension does not support remote custom libraries as of now. For this reason, it is recommended to create and make larger edits to drawio files through the web app.

// end::drawio-extension[]

For information on how to integrate the ASAM custom library for Draw.io, see the xref:DrawIOGuide.adoc[Draw.io Guide].

== Docker

// tag::docker-extension[]
The Docker extension lets you directly interact with Docker through Visual Studio Code. You can run, for example, the docker-compose.yml directly without having to open a console or using Docker Desktop.

.Docker (id: ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
image::install_docker.png[alt=Search and find the extension 'Docker']
