== General Guidelines

- Applies to all branches on the OSI repositories
- All lowercase
- Use hyphens not spaces


== Change Types

`feature`:: branches that enhance the standard or add additional features
`fix`:: Bug fixes to contradictions or errors in the standard
`doc`:: Documentation changes only
`experimental`:: (advanced development) Branches where developers want to try out or demonstrate some ideas but don't expect their changes to be integrated directly
