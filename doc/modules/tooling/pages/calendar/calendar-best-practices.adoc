All OpenX projects share a calendar under the email address of {openx-calendar-mail}.
**This MUST be included on all meetings taking place for the projects to make sure it is up to date.**
Every project's MS Teams group has a tab in the _General_ channel called *_Calendar_* where you can refer to it.
**The OpenX calendar can be {calendar-url}[viewed online,window=_blank] as well.**
