**This should be included on all meetings taking place for the projects to make sure it is up to date.**
Every project's MS Teams group has a tab in the _General_ channel called *_Calendar_* where you can refer to it.

== Troubleshooting / Known Issues

=== I cannot subscribe using the provided link
Make sure you use the {calendar-ics}[**ics link**], not the web url.
Subscribing requires an ics link or file.
The web url ({calendar-url}[link,window=_blank]) is *ONLY* for viewing the calendar online without subscribing to it.
