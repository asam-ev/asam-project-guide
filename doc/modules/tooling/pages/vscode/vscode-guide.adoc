Visual Studio Code is a powerful code and text editor that can be highly individualized and adapted to the task at hand using the existing extensions for it. Here, you get an overview over how Visual Studio Code is structured.

For the Visual Studio Code extensions recommended by ASAM as well as specific tutorials, see the links under <<Related Topics>>.

== Activity Bar

The Activity Bar contains a direct access to many important base or extensions features. The following image shows standard functionality, but some extensions like GitLens will add their own icon and features.

// Explorer - shows all of the files and folders you have access to
// Search – Find and replace in files
// Git – all git related commands, only active if in a git repository
// Extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.
