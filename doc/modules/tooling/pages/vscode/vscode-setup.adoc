=== Install Extensions

Visual Studio Code can be adapted to each project's and the user's needs. This is done by installing and using extensions. This section shows how to install a new extension from the marketplace. As an example, we will use the AsciiDoc extension.

The AsciiDoc extension for VSCode allows for easy creation and supported editing of AsciiDoc or adoc files within VSCode. For shortcuts and tips, see the documentation of the extension. You can access that documentation when you click on the extension in the marketplace.

. Access the extensions window through the VSCode menu bar -> View -> Extensions.
