== Context
In order to work locally on the repositories and their content hosted at the {gitlab}, users can install and set up Git on their local computer.
Git can also interface directly with __{vscode}__, making changing and updating files from within one tool an easy option.

== Result
* Git is installed locally.
* Git credentials (SSH) is configured

== Prerequisites
* For direct integration: {vscode} is installed

== How
Git requires a multi-step installation.
The following sections describe each part of this setup sequentially.

=== Install git
. If you are unsure if git is installed, you can check by entering the following in a shell window and confirming:
+
[source]
----
git --version
----
+
If a git version is returned, git is already installed on your system.
. If git is not installed, follow the instructions on https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[how to install git^]

=== Configure user credentials
After installation of Git, **configure your user credentials** that Git uses when checking in changed content from your PC to the {gitlab}.
To make sure your commits match your name and email details, a one time configuration is necessary.

. Open a shell or terminal (e.g. {powershell}) window
. Execute the following command and replace the entries _"FIRST_NAME_, _LAST_NAME"_  accordingly:
+
[source,git]
----
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
----
+
.Setting git user name for Max Mustermann
====
[source,git]
----
git config --global user.name Max Mustermann
----
====
. Next, execute the following command and replace the entry _"+MY_NAME@example.com+"_ with your comany's email:
+
[source,git]
----
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
----
+
.Setting email for Max Mustermann working at company
====
[source,git]
----
git config --global user.email max.mustermann@company.com
----
====
+
NOTE: If no error is returned, the configuration step has been successful.


=== __OPTIONAL__: SSH Key Pair

To ensure you don't have to enter your login details every time you want to interact with the repository, add an SSH key to your account.

. Generate an SSH key pair following the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#generate-an-ssh-key-pair[official instructions^].
+
TIP: Entering a passphrase is optional and leads to additional steps every time you connect to the remote, so it is not recommended.
. Add the generated SSH public key to your GitLab account by following https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account[these instructions^].
. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#verify-that-you-can-connect[Verify that you can connect^]


== Troubleshooting / Known Issues
=== I cannot click "Next" after selecting Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor during installation
If you cannot click "Next", make sure Visual Studio Code is already installed.
Return to the previous step and continue again.
Now, the "next" button should be active.

=== My SSH keys are not working
Make sure that the ssh-agent is running:

. Open a shell or terminal window
. Type the following command, hit Enter, and check the status:
+
[source,Shell]
----
Get-Service ssh-agent
----
+
.. If the status is "Stopped", type the following, hit Enter, and check the StartType.
+
[source,Shell]
----
Get-Service ssh-agent | Select StartType
----
+
.. If the StartType is "Disabled", activate the SSH Agent.
See <<My SSH agent is deactivated>>. +
Continue here after your SSH agent has bee activated.

. Enter the following command and hit Enter
+
[source,Shell]
----
Start-Service ssh-agent
----

=== My SSH agent is deactivated
NOTE: This requires administration rights.
If you do not have these, request support from your IT department.

. Open a shell or terminal window with **Administration** rights
. Set the SSH Agent to start manually by typing the following command and hitting Enter:
+
[source,Shell]
----
Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
----

=== I cannot add my private key to the SSH agent
This cannot be done in the Administration {powershell} window if your Admin account is not your user account!
Otherwise, Windows will complain about unprotected private key files!
Switch to a non-administrator PowerShell and execute the command again.
