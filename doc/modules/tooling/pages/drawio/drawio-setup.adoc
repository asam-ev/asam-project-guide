== Context
__{asam}__ uses Draw.io for creating custom diagrams for standards and documentation.
The user can choose to use the {drawio-url}[**web access**] (**recommended**) or install the software locally.
ASAM provides a {library-repo}[custom Draw.io library] which contains custom standard image elements and visualization structures that can be reused in new diagrams.
To be able to access the {library-repo}[ASAM asset library], follow the instructions below.

== Result
The user can access Draw.io with the ASAM asset library connected to create and edit diagrams.

== Prerequisites
* Local Setup (__{vscode}__): xref:vscode.adoc[] is installed

== How
Draw.io can be used either locally (through the dedicated app <<Draw.io App (Desktop),Draw.io Deskop>> or through the <<VSCode Extension,VS Code Extension>>) or with the <<Remote Setup, web app>>.

=== Local setup

==== Draw.io App (Desktop)

. Download the app from {drawio-download}[here^].
. Check out the {library-repo}[asset library repository^]
. Open the draw.io app and either create a new diagram or open any existing one
. Click _File_ -> _Open Library..._
. Select the xml file from the asset library repository (local) and click _Open_.

==== Draw.io VSCode extension

include::compendium:partial$vscode/drawio.adoc[]

NOTE: At this time, the VS Code extension does not provide url links to libraries.
The only option to add the library is to download a copy and add it manually.

. Install the drawio extensions in __{vscode}__
. Check out the {library-repo}[asset library repository^]
. In Visual Studio Code, access the extension settings for Draw.io Integration and open the settings.json file
. Add the following lines and replace `\<<filepath/filename>>` with the path to the downloaded library file (.xml):
+
[source,json]

    "hediet.vscode-drawio.customLibraries": [
        {
            "libName": "ASAM Standard Library",
            "file": "<<filepath/filename>>",
            "entryId": "ASAM"
        }
    ],
----
+
NOTE: Remove the comma after the last braket ("]") if there is no other line before the closing curly bracket ("}").
. Activate the library from any drawio file through "More Shapes...", selecting the ASAM Standard Library and confirming the selection
