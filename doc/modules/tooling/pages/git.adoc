Git is a free software for tracking changes in a set of files (versioning).
It is typically used for coordinating collaborative development (programming) of source code or other text-based content.

NOTE: xref:gitlab.adoc[] is the webhosted tool that provides a central hub and storage space (repository) and functions as remote for Git.

== Git at ASAM
__{asam}__ recommends using Git for working on a repository locally:

* Checking out a remote repository
