Visual Studio Code is the suggested solution for checking out repositories and files from {gitlab}, adding and editing files, and pushing changes back to {gitlab}.
However, users may choose any compatible program(s) instead, as long as {gitlab} stays the single point of truth for project files.
Alternatively, users may also choose to work completly through {gitlab} by using the Web IDE provided there.
See {gitlab} for more information.
