{gitlab-url}[GitLab] provides an integrated working environment and text editor with which users can directly create and edit files without having to install xref:git.adoc[Git] or an editor like xref:vscode.adoc[Visual Studio Code].
See xref:compendium:gitlab/gitlab-ide-guide.adoc[the GitLab Web IDE Guide] in the compendium for more information.

However, note that you will still need to configure your accounts for the mandatory tools.
