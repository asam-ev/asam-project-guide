//tag::project-lead[]

== Role Description
The Project Lead is the main responsible for a project.
They coordinate general activities, track the progression, decide on changes and the project direction, and are the main contact point for ASAM for that project.

Often, the original Idea Giver or the Proposal Submitter also become the Project Lead, but this is not mandatory.

A Project Lead is responsible both for the project's content and its coordination.
However, a project can decide to pass the organizational tasks on to a contracted project support (typically: a xref:role-specific:service-provider.adoc[]) so that the Project Lead can focus on the content specification of the project.

=== Responsibilities
The Project Lead is responsible for:

* Coordinating all project activities
* Organizing project-wide events
* Presenting the current status to ASAM (__{tsc}__, __{gtm}s__)
* Ensure the project stays on track

=== Expectations
