  Every ASAM Project has mandatory and optional roles, the optional roles depend on the size and the structure of the project.

ASAM projects have a couple of standard roles:

ASAM Global Technology Manager (GTM):: A GTM is an ASAM employee focussed on coordinating project processes and the background work behind a project.
ASAM Standard User:: An ASAM Standard User is someone that is part of the ASAM community but not involved in the project development at hand.
Workgroup (WG) Member:: An ASAM User that is involved directly in the development of an ASAM standard.
They are a participant in a workgroup (WG) of a standard, a subdivision of the overall project.
Workgroup (WG) Leader:: The WG member that leads the respective workgroup.
Project Lead:: The person responsible for leading and coordinating all project activities.
Normally, this position is filled by one of the leading project members in the project.
Technical Steering Committee ({tsc}) Member:: A member of committee responsible for approving or rejecting projects and proposals.
Reviewer:: An ASAM Standard User or WG Member that reviews a draft or release candidate for a new or updated standard.
Technical Writer:: Formats and writes the document(s) of the standard based on the provided input from the WG members in a formalized and standard-conform way.
Service Provider:: Provides additional services necessary for the standard development.
