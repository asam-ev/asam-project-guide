The convergence of the automotive markets with new trends in digitalization, autonomous driving, alternative propulsion, and vehicle as a service as enabled by new IT business models provides many new technical concepts that can be standardized in ASAM.

Standardization requires three components:

* A technical concept
* A market need for the standard
* Passionate, technical experts who convene at regular intervals to define the requirements and the implementation

To make sure that these requirements are met, ASAM has launched this https://www.asam.net/active-projects/ideation/how-it-works/[ideation platform^].

Technical experts from all over the globe can post concepts and ideas, receive feedback, and drive new standardization topics.

* The basic idea is well and precisely articulated
* The market need has been identified

//end::expectations-start[]

//tag::expectations-finish[]

* The idea has been accepted by ASAM
* A first draft of the proposed idea has been set up ("Basis for Proposal")
* The minimum number of required participants has been reached or surpassed

//end::expectations-finish[]

//tag::how[]

To enter an idea, make sure to prepare all the required submission content first.

This is how it works:

. Send an email with your concept, idea, question or feedback to ideation@asam.net
. The ASAM Office will contact you to clarify the details (or answer your questions)
. It must be investigated if there are any other standards or standardization projects in that area
. The ASAM Office will then post the mutually agreed concept
. ASAM Members world-wide will be able to comment on the idea, and enroll in an ideation project

//end::how[]

//tag::development[]
When enough interest is raised (subject to suitable market relevance), ASAM will host a workshop to further develop the topic.
If required, an ideation project is being set up that will meet regularly.

While the idea is being developed and fleshed out, the Idea Giver must gather enough project participants to be able to transition the idea to the proposal phase.

//tag::next[]
Once all requirements are met (content and number of participants) and the idea is accepted by ASAM, the project transitions to the xref:getting-involved:proposal_phase.adoc[proposal phase].
The final goal is to transfer the idea into the regular xref:development_phase.adoc[Standard Development Process].
