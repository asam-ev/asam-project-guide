The Office checks the proposal document for formal compliance.
Once the document is accepted, the Office checks the document into the TSC file repository, puts the proposal on the https://www.asam.net/active-projects/proposals/[ASAM website^] for download and publishes the proposal via a newsletter- and optional webpage-article.

Members are invited to enroll for participation in the upcoming project.
The Office manages the registration of project group members during this phase.
If a member intends to commit a work effort of less than 50% of the average of the work efforts committed by all other project group members, then the Office can deny the registration.
The member or the office can escalate the issue to the TSC.

The content of the proposal is not changed during the publication period.
An exception are error corrections and the registration of additional project group members.

Members of the TSC review the content of the proposal and clarify open questions with the submitter.

The minimum publication period for project proposals is four weeks and shall not exceed eight weeks.
