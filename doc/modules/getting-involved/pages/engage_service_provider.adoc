== Context
Some projects require more or different capabilities than the participating companies can provide.
In these cases, the project will determine the need for service providers during the proposal phase.
Once the project has been accepted, the project group sends out service requests for the open topics and starts the service provider selection process described below.

== Result
* Options for service providers have been vetted
* One or more service providers have been hired

== Prerequisites
* The project proposal has been accepted by the __{tsc}__.
* The project has planned budget for hiring service providers.

== How
Tasks can be bundled or offered separately. +
Service providers can apply for one or more bundles, or they can limit their offer to select parts of one or more bundles.

. The working group writes a call for tender.
. Interested service providers apply for a presentation to present themselves and get more input on the tasks required from them
. The group requests offers from interesting service providers
. The service providers and the working group negotiate terms and conditions
. The working group decides on a service provider

== What Happens Next
The contracted service provider or providers receive a kickoff workshop for their project and tasks.
If they have not worked with ASAM before, the ideal starting place for general topics is this Project Guide, particularly the xref:role-specific:service-provider.adoc[Service Provider topics page].
