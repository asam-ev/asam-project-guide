NOTE: This page describes how project members can initiate a webinar.
If you are looking to join a scheduled webinar, see xref:getting-involved:join_webinar.adoc[] instead.

== Context
In order to gather feedback on project development and decisions from outside as well as to give an introduction to a standard to non-project-members, a project can decide to host a webinar.

There are different reasons for wanting to initiate a webinar:

* Find new project members
* Identify new use cases
* Gather feedback from the industry
* Give a new standard (version) some traction

== Result
A webinar is prepared and publicly announced through the ASAM channels.

== Prerequisites
* You must be a project member
* You must be able to provide one or more experienced presenters
* The webinar must be announced at least 4 weeks ahead of time
+
NOTE: Presenters *need not* be project or even ASAM members in case the topic is not confidential, but interesting for project progress.

== How
. Prepare the webinar outline
. __OPTIONAL__: Create a presentation draft
. __OPTIONAL__: Prepare a list of speakers
. Propose your webinar to your __{gtm}__ contact for support


NOTE: All optional steps will have to be carried out before the event in any case.
It is recommended to do them before approaching the GTM contact to speed up the process.
