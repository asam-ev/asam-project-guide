The Project Proposal is an https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc document^] laying out the proposed project for a new standard / version of a released standard. +
The https://code.asam.net/common/templates/proposal-template[**Project Proposal template**^] is located in the ASAM GitLab, where you can find more information on its structure and default content.

Each proposal must cover the following topics:

* <<Commitments>>
* <<Project Timeline>>
* <<Project Deliverables>>
* <<Project Structure>>
* <<Additional Project Funding>>
* <<Market Analysis/Relevance>>
* <<Relevance To ASAM>>
* <<Project Type>>

== Commitments
Prospect participants of the project must commit to it ahead of time. +
There are different types of commitments possible:

* <<Content Commitment>>
* <<Review Commitment>>

Each type comes with requirements that are explained in their respective section.

=== Content Commitment
TODO

=== Review Commitment
TODO

== Project Timeline
Each project must plan its own timeline ahead of time.
Since things change, the timeline may be altered later.
However, the timeline should still be realistic with the knowledge available during the proposal phase.

The Project Timeline must contain milestones for each <<Project Deliverables,Project Deliverable>> and account for

* Kickoff
* Start of review
* End of review
* Finalization
* Presentation at TSC
* Target release date

== Project Deliverables
The proposal must define the deliverables it intends to hand over to ASAM at the end of the project.
include::compendium:page$ASAM/deliverables.adoc[leveloffset=+1, tag=body]

== Project Structure
The proposal must specify the expected working groups and their designated leads. +
The proposal must also define the expected roles (see xref:role-specific:main.adoc[] for typical role specifications) in the project.

== Additional Project Funding
The proposal must define whether additional funding beyond the standard budget calculation is required.

== Market Analysis/Relevance
The proposal must provide an initial market analysis and show the relevance for it. +
A standard without merit is not to be supported by ASAM.
Similarly, a standard with (nearly) identical content as another standard is obsolete.

== Relevance To ASAM
TODO

== Project Type
The proposal must specify the xref:concepts:project-types.adoc[type of project] it wants to start.
