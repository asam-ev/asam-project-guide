== The Proposal Document
The Project Proposal is a written document that is submitted to the __{tsc}__ for project approval before any project at ASAM may start. +
All committed participants (the Idea Giver, the Proposal Submitter, and all prospective Workgroup Members) can participate in writing the proposal document (the Proposal Submitter actually has to participate in the <<Finalizing The Proposal,finalization step>>). +
See xref:getting-involved:proposal/proposal_document.adoc[] for more information on the document and its intended contents.


== How To Contribute

include::compendium:partial$conventions/git-based_workflow.adoc[tag=short]

To contribute to a Project Proposal, project members can either <<Content Definition,contribute through GitLab issues>> or <<How to contribute to a proposal directly in AsciiDoc files,contribute directly in AsciiDoc>>.
However, at least one person must transfer all content to the AsciiDoc file eventually. +
Both ways of contribution can be performed xref:tooling:working-without-software-installation.adoc[without software installation] directly through the respective web interface.
If you prefer to work on your local computer, ASAM recommends using xref:tooling:git.adoc[Git] and xref:tooling:vscode.adoc[Visual Studio Code].


== Proposal Contribution Guidelines
IMPORTANT: All writers shall follow these guidelines when writing for the Proposal document.

include::compendium:page$ASAM/phase-02_proposal/proposal_guidelines.adoc[leveloffset=+1, tags=body;!roles]


== ASAM Editorial Guide
ASAM provides an Editorial Guide containing the writing guidelines applicable to all ASAM documents.
The current version of the Editorial Guide is located in the xref:compendium:writing_guidelines/editorial_guide.adoc[**Project Guide Compendium**].

h|TL;DR
a| * Create the xref:getting-involved:proposal/proposal_document.adoc#_project_timeline[milestone plan]
* Finalize content for submission
* Review content with proposal team
|===
The Proposal Submitter (and all other involved writers) shall consider the following input for finalizing the project proposal:

- the existing Proposal draft,
- meeting minutes of the xref:getting-involved:proposal_phase.adoc#_proposal_workshop[Proposal Workshop],
- relevant papers from concept projects (if any).

The Submitter shall estimate the work efforts of the project and create a xref:getting-involved:proposal/proposal_document.adoc#_project_timeline[milestone plan].
include::getting-involved:partial$milestone_plan_duration.adoc[]

The Office checks the proposal document for formal compliance and understandability.

The proposal may contain a request for video conferencing support through the Office, if project group members originate from locations that would require long-distance (i.e. inter-continental) business trips to regularly participate at project meetings. +
The Submitter shall send out the proposal to all participants of the Proposal Workshop (if this occurred) for review before xref:getting-involved:proposal/submit_proposal.adoc[submitting it].
