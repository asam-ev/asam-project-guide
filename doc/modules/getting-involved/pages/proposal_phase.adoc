== Process Overview
The purpose of the proposal phase is to transfer xref:ideation_phase.adoc[ideas for a standard development project] into an ASAM project proposal and to obtain a decision on it.

In this phase, the idea is further analyzed, central requirements are formulated, the expected effort quantified, and the timeline defined.
In addition to that, interested parties can sign up during this phase for project participation. +
The proposal is released to attract more attention as well as for transparency.
It is then submitted and presented to the {tsc} for approval.
If the approval is not given, the proposal can be improved and updated before presenting it again, or the project is dropped by the Idea Giver. +
If the Project Proposal is approved, it transitions to the xref:development_phase.adoc[Standard Development phase].

The following sections summarize the steps described above.
If you want to learn more about how to participate in this phase, check out the pages in this chapter or follow the links in the relevant section on this page.

== Proposal Phase Timeline
The typical proposal phase timeline consists of

* 8-12 weeks for creating the draft
* 1 day of Proposal Workshop (announced 4-6 weeks ahead of time)
* 1-4 weeks of finalizing the draft and enrollment
* proposal publication
* proposal review, presentation, and project decision

== Proposal Phase Steps
The Proposal phase consists of the following steps, which are explained in detail in their own sections:

* <<Repository Setup>>
* <<Draft Creation>>
* <<Enrollment Process>>
* <<Proposal Workshop>>
* <<Finalizing The Proposal>>
* <<Submission>>
* <<Publication>>
* <<Decision>>

=== Repository Setup
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To set up the proposal repository.

|Responsible
|{role-gtm}
|===

At the beginning of the Proposal phase, ASAM sets up the repository where the proposal content is kept and discussed. +
See xref:proposal/01_setup.adoc[].

=== Draft Creation
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|Create an initial draft in preparation of the Proposal Workshop.

|Responsible
|{role-idea-giver}

|Involved
|{role-wg-member}
|===

Before the proposal is first presented to interested parties in the Proposal Workshop, an initial draft must be created that can be discussed properly.

See xref:proposal/02_contributing.adoc[].

=== Enrollment Process
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To enroll participants in the planned project.

|Responsible
|{role-member}

|Involved
|{role-gtm}
|===

Interested parties can start to enroll for the proposed project in parallel to the other Proposal Phase activities. +
See xref:signing_up.adoc[] for available options during this process and more detail information on it.

For more information on the enrollment list, see xref:compendium:ASAM/guides/how_to_enrollment_list.adoc[].


=== Proposal Workshop
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
a|* To discuss and agree the content of a project proposal.
Results of an optional concept project shall be included.
** Use cases
** Features
** Requirements
** Market relevance justification
** Prioritization of features and requirements
** Backward compatibility
* To determine the Proposal Submitter (must be "active" ASAM member)

|Responsible
|{role-gtm}, in collaboration with initiating member(s) ({role-idea-giver}).

|Involved
|{role-member} and {role-standard-user}, particularly technical domain experts, internal end-user support experts, product managers, development managers
|===

The Office is responsible for the preparation and carrying out of the Proposal Workshop.
This is done in close cooperation with the member(s), who initiated the process and are the major drivers of the idea.

Proposal Workshops are open to all ASAM members.
Non-members can participate upon invitation by the Office. +
By default, the Office moderates the workshop.
This task can be passed to a member, if appropriate.

If there is significant interest in the proposed project in different regions (primarily in North America, Europe, East Asia), then the Office organizes meetings in a way that equally allows all members from those regions to influence the results of the Proposal Workshop.

The Office sends out a public invitation for the Proposal Workshop at least four weeks prior to the event with a brief description of the goals and content of the proposed project.
The Office also informs the TSC.


=== Finalizing The Proposal
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To finalize the project proposal and to create the project milestone plan.

|Responsible
|{role-proposal-submitter}

|Involved
|{role-gtm}, {role-wg-member}
|===

The Proposal Submitter finalizes the concept based on the output from the <<Proposal Workshop>> and prepares it for <<Submission>>. +
The Office assists the submitter by giving advice with respect to ASAM guideline and best practices.
The Office checks the proposal document for formal compliance and understandability.

The submitter shall send out the proposal to all participants of the Proposal Workshop (if this occurred) for review before submitting it to the TSC.


=== Submission
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To submit the finalized project proposal to __{asam}__

|Responsible
|{role-proposal-submitter}

|Involved
|{role-gtm} plus at least two {role-wg-member}
|===

The Proposal Submitter sends the Proposal document to the Office and declares this to be his official proposal submission. +
Besides the submitter, at least two further members must support the proposal and be listed as participants for the proposed project group.


=== Publication
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To allow members and the TSC to read and review the project proposal, to clarify open questions and to allow members to enroll for participation in the upcoming project.

|Responsible
|{role-gtm}

|Involved
|{role-tsc-member}, {role-member}
|===

The Office checks the proposal document for formal compliance.
Once the document is accepted, the Office checks the document into the TSC file repository, puts the proposal on the https://www.asam.net/active-projects/proposals/[ASAM website^] for download and publishes the proposal via a newsletter and an optional webpage article.

Members are invited to xref:signing_up.adoc[enroll for participation] in the upcoming project.
The Office manages the registration of project group members during this phase.

The content of the proposal is not changed during the publication period.
An exception are error corrections and the registration of additional project group members. +
Members of the TSC review the content of the proposal and clarify open questions with the Submitter.

The minimum publication period for project proposals is four weeks and shall not exceed eight weeks.


=== Decision
[cols="1h,20"]
|===
|Purpose
|To approve or reject the project proposal.

|Responsible
|{role-tsc-member}

|Involved
|{role-proposal-submitter}
|===

Submitted Project Proposals are put on the agenda of the next available TSC meeting.
Proposals are handled during the meeting via a three-step process:

. Submitter presents the proposal to the TSC members.
. TSC members are given the opportunity to ask questions.
. TSC members discuss the proposal (without submitter's presence) and then proceed with casting their votes on the proposal.

The TSC does not modify the content of the proposal.
If this is deemed to be necessary, then the proposal shall be rejected.

The TSC may add constraints or conditions for the execution of the proposed project.
They are noted in the meeting minutes. +
The TSC may decide to approve only some of the defined work packages of the project and ask for re-submission of the proposal with a content update for the unapproved work packages. +
The TSC might assign a mentor for each new standard or major version development project.
The mentor shall be a member of the TSC.

The voting is carried out in accordance with the TSC voting rules.
The Board Representative for the TSC has to confirm the decision. +
The proposed project becomes effective with the given approval of both parties.
The approved project proposals are regarded as the work order for the new project group.
