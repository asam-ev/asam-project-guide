== Context
Standardization requires constant reviewing of its documents.
After the project group has reached a presentable version, this is released for __{asam}__ members to review.
If a document or documents enter the xref:standardization:review-phase.adoc#_c2_public_draft_review[ASAM member review phase], it is announced through the https://www.asam.net/newsletter/[newsletter^] and the https://www.asam.net/active-projects/public-review/[ASAM website^].
