== Process Overview

Info page:: https://www.asam.net/active-projects/ideation/how-it-works/[window=_blank]

The convergence of the automotive markets with new trends in digitalization, autonomous driving, alternative propulsion, and vehicle as a service as enabled by new IT business models provides many new technical concepts that can be standardized in ASAM.

Standardization requires three components:

* A technical concept
* A market need for the standard
* Passionate, technical experts who convene at regular intervals to define the requirements and the implementation

To make sure that these requirements are met, ASAM has launched this https://www.asam.net/active-projects/ideation/how-it-works/[ideation platform^]. +
Technical experts from all over the globe can post concepts and ideas, receive feedback, and drive new standardization topics.
