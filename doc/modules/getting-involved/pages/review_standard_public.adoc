== Context
Standardization requires constant reviewing of its documents.
Some projects have a public release candidate.
These can be reviewed by any person without having to be an ASAM member.

If a document or documents is released as a public release candidate, it is announced through the https://www.asam.net/newsletter/[newsletter^] and the https://www.asam.net/active-projects/public-review/[ASAM website^].

This review occurs at the end of a standardization project and is optional.

This description is intended for all people interested in giving feedback for such a review document, independent of ASAM membership status.

== Result
Comprehensive and comprehensible feedback has been submitted to the project group on the review document(s).

== Prerequisites
* Documents must be a public release candidate

== How
. Access the "Public Review" page (through the website or the newsletter)
. Select the standard you would like to review to be forwarded to its review page
. Read through the document(s) carefully
. Provide feedback on the relevant page through the integrated "Submit feedback" button or sending an email to the provided review address using the xref:compendium:templates/review_feedback_template.adoc[]

NOTE: The sent email creates a new issue in the ASAM remote repository using the GitLab Service Desk feature.
You can find more information on using GitLab Service Desk under xref:compendium:tools/gitlab/review_with_service_desk.adoc[].
